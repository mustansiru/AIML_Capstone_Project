3.battery= 4.5/5 battery is good bt charging speed is like a rocket..,half an hour ur battery 70% charged
4. sound = 5/5 outstanding., crystal clear and loud too
5. processer= 855+ and oxygen os great.,no heating issue while u playing any game

I liked everything in this mobile
It is smooth, fast, powerful
The latest Oxygen OS.
ALL ARE SUPER

I liked very much is it's PREMIUM DISPLAY.....
You feel yourself as superior.
1+ is a brand that no one can beat or at least touch.

Some rival companies are saying that flagship killer is coming but I would say you can never beat a Oxygen OS......

If you are affordable for this just blindly go for the pro .......
Even if you feel it as expensive, gather money & definitely go for this.

There are some minor quality issues with camera
But surely by the time you read this review 1+ would have definitely posted an update and fixed those small thingsüôÇ.........

Never compare 1+ with other brands they are not even worth to sit beside 1+.........

But the one plus just making fool like if you bought 2nd latest device like 6t when you want to exchange to 1st latest device like 7pro they just give you 10k do you think your 6t is only value of 10k it's also one plus device
If you buy 7pro and want to upgrade with exchange after months one plus will offer you like 15k
Do you think it's worth

Screen not responding to my touch,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2019,"There is an issue were reported by my side. Which is ""screen not responding"" to my touch. Actually i have made a chat with one plus india team, as they have advised me to return/ replace the product.
1.Actually the phone now OK
2.At that time after updating the latest version of OS,(After 1 hr) the phone goes hung and the screen doesn't respond to my touch dont know what is the actual issue still now.
3.But the physical switches like power button, volume, silent mode and even face lock and finger print sensors are worked smoothly. Only the screen were not responds. I cant able to restart the phone also.
4.Then the one plus india team advised to remove the screen card , and i test it but no luck.
5.Then advised to press power button + volume down button (Factory data reset) till 20- 30 sec but no responding.
6.Finally i decide to go for replacement, at that time i realize  there is no replacement as becoz its out of stock(Not sure the reason).
7.For a last chance i just press Power button+ Volume up button god grace its restarted at the time and the issue cleared. But not sure which is due to the OS updation and all and don't know whether issue came again or not.

Before that I was using OnePlus1, So I am part of OnePlus community for almost past 5 years. Therefore, I have witnessed the journey of OnePlus in India from the beginning. Let's get into the details:

1. Display - Amazing display with Fluid AMOLED and 90 Hz refresh rate. It is way better than OnePlus5 and OnePlus6 also. I haven't compared it with 6T. After using this phone for almost 2 weeks, I feel OnePlus5's display is dull and lifeless.
2. Sound - The Dolby Atmos speakers are the best I have ever experienced in any phone. I compared the same with both OP5 and OP6 and there is a significant improvement in sound quality. The phone has speakers on both the sides but 85% sound comes from the bottom one.
3. Battery Life - I haven't used the phone for extensive gaming; with moderate level of gaming (2 hrs.) and 3-4 hrs of screen time and 1.5 hrs of calling time it would easily give you 24 hrs. For cricket lovers, a full charge of phone will give you 70-75 overs with 70% volume.
4. Camera - It is far better than OP5 and OP6, especially the low light clicks, but it could have been better for this price.
5. Performance - I have never faced any problem with the performance of any OP phone and I am sure this phone will surpass your expectation.

Downsides:
1. It is very heavy compared to OP5, 206 gm, you'll feel the weight in your pocket
2. There is no 3.5 mm earphone/headphone audio jack
3. There is single type c jack for both audio and charging
4. The finger print sensor is not as fast and smooth as the previous versions, but it has improved significantly after 2 system updates provided by OP. I hope it'll improve further with future updates
5. The face unlock is quick but not quick like earlier phones, because of pop up front camera

There are some teething problems, which I think we face with every new smart phone these days. I think, it would be sorted with future system updates. Overall, it is an incredible product from OnePlus and certainly the best one ever offered by them. I am sure it won‚Äôt disappoint you and it would be worth every penny you are going to spend for this phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros
Figure Print Reader really Fast

Cons
Not satisfied with camera due to below reason's
1. Default clicked photo been using only 12mp camera
2. If you want to click photo with 48mp camera 1st you need to switch Photo mode to Pro mode than click  on top section where JPG tap on it and than click on JPG 48mp now after all these setps follow finally you able to click photo with actually 48mp
3. 9:16 ration missed due to this can't be able to view clicked photo on Full HD TV.
4. Photo clicked with main camera specially for wide view is not been stabled click most of the captured part views blurry :(

# Sleek and Stylish in Design
# Amazing display and great performance
# Awesome sound clarity with Dolby Atmos speakers.
# Camera clarity is absolutely amazing. The images are pretty cool and lively.
# Oxygen OS is a big plus with the latest Android 10.
# Charging speed is insane with warp charging 30. In less than 40 to 45 mins, it will hit 0% to 100%
# 90 Hz refresh is lightning fast and smooth.
# Pretty good in-display fingerprint sensor.
# Needless to say, this is the best phone for PUBG, COD and other high-end games.

Cons:
# Battery backup might let you down, with 3800 mAH battery it lasts only 15 to 18 hours with moderate usage. If you play games expect it to drain sooner.
# No headset in the box, which could be a disappointment for the first time OnePlus users.
# And this phone have USB type C port for earphones, which is not quite uncommon though.

Having these minor hiccups, hands down this is certainly the best premium phone in the market at this price range.

Pros:
1. Refresh rate of 90hz makes the transitions fluid.
2. You get Android 10 out of box.
3. Oxygen os is close to stock Android, so it's not full of bloatware
  and is free of any ads
4. The unboxing experience is worth mentioning.
5. The triple camera setup does a commendable job.

Cons:
1. Battery of 3800 mAh is considerably less. The phone lasts a day
  with 9hrs screen on time
2. If you are switching from iPhone then you'll face little hickups
  while transferring the data.
3. There's no headphone jack, so you'll have to go with a Bluetooth
  headset or have to buy an extra connector",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews

For dynamic sund lovers the stereo speakers work really fine. Haptic motor is improved and you feel that while using the phone. Fingerprint reader situated under the screen is the fastest fingerprint reader in under screen fingerprint readers on different phones but comparing this with physical fingerprint sensors is not fair.And finally coming to its 90hz panel..its so good that once you get used to the fluidity of this panel you won't see anything on phone having frame rate below 90hz, the experience is magical. As a bonus you get warp charger 30T which is 18% faster than one plus 7 pro, its really handy to juice up your phone rapidly.

But finally ordered and a big surprise. I live in tier 3 city and the phone was scheduled to be delivered the very next day. Such super fast delivery has never been heard. I was able to reschedule the delivery date easily on chat with customer care executive. Excellent..
 Pros .
1. Outstanding display. The quality of the display can not be told in words . It has to be experienced to feel.
2. Camera quality. The default 12MP pics are sharp and feel life like. The 48MP in Pro mode is somey out of this world.
3. Battery. The 4000 mAh battery is more than enough for a normal user ever at QHD and 90 refresh rate. If you need to last longer, just reduce the screen resolution. The battery was 67% when I received the phone. Even after 1 system update install, 20 app updates from playstore, and setting up the entire phone, the battery stands at 31% after 17 hrs of starting the phone for first time. Great.
4. Hardware. The SD855 is more than sufficient for most users while perfect suited for a heavy user.
5. Warp charger supplied with phone.
6. Thick transparent cover supplied and has cuts at right places which don't obstruct the moving front camera.

Cons
1. Pricey.
2. The pre applied screen protector is good for nothing. It already had bubbles in it and within 6hrs of receiving, it had worked loose from all 4 corners. It won't last long and will surely peel off soon.
3. Nothing supplied. At 53k, leave a wireless headphone, it doesn't ships with even a wired headphone.
4. Packaging could've been better while shipping a 53k phone. Even a 200 Rs phone cover has better packing. No bubble wrap to prevent jerks and shocks. Just a Amazon branded cardboard and nothing else.

Desired.
1. Wish it had shipped with a wireless headphone.
2. A pre applied 3d tempered glass for better protection.

Update. All this is rubbish. The phone has developed a fine green line at the edge of display and within 4 months of purchase, the display nuas to be changed. And as always, service center terms this as physical damage and refuses to honor warranty.
Never ever buying OnePlus. Even a phone worth 4000 doesn't has problems in 4 months.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews

Previously known as flagship killer for better pricing... But now meh... Looks like Oneplus is trying to go as the likes of Samsung, and Apple of being EXPENSIVE. Overall i liked the performance, it's crazy fast, 90hz refresh rate makes the overall experience much better. Charging is super fast but, but the camera could have been much better, day light photos are good but when you try to take videos with the wide angle camera, it crops the frame. Performance is top notch, display is only thing I bought this phone. Super sharp and crystal clear QHD+ Oled display gives an immersive experience while watching videos and Netflix content. But battery life should have been improved from its last counterparts. On paper its 4000 mAh but because of the display that consumes more battery, it last atleast a day barely.

I bought a One Plus 7T handset on date 29th dec.  I have recently start experiencing some issues with my phone. The phone got switched off while it was still completely charged. I had to take it to the service center. Though they were able to start it, I am still experiencing some issues like the phone hanging while use and unclarity and echos while on calls. Are these known issues with 1+7T handsets or probably I could have gotten a defective piece? Please can you help with getting these issues fixed or getting the handset replaced? I would be very grateful if you could help me with this?

‚úîÔ∏èExcellent, premium, 'dreamy' new design, with high quality materials and top-notch build quality - the¬†frosted glass at the back¬†just adds a new dimension to not just the visual appeal but also the in-hand feel.

‚úîÔ∏èThe front has¬†a smaller teardrop notch than the OnePlus 7

‚úîÔ∏èA bit smaller than the OnePlus 7 Pro and slightly easier to hold¬†(it's still on the large side though on absolute scale, so if you don't like big phones, you might want to reconsider)

‚úîÔ∏èBasic water resistance¬†(though it's not IP rated)

‚úîÔ∏èSnappy in-display fingerprint scanner

‚úñÔ∏èThe camera bump at the back may be an eyesore¬†for some (it's subjective though)

‚óæDisplay

‚úîÔ∏èGorgeous, super smooth 90Hz AMOLED display¬†- along with the display on the OnePlus 7 Pro, this is one of the most amazing displays out there on any smartphone - you will enjoy how much zippier and smoother the phone feels scrolling through things like web pages and apps

‚úîÔ∏èStrong brightness¬†and great sunlight legibility

‚úîÔ∏èThis time it's also¬†a flat screen without the curved edges of the OnePlus 7 Pro - while that makes it look perhaps less stunning, it's a more practical design¬†from a usability point of view

‚óæSoftware

‚úîÔ∏èOnePlus continues to have one of the most refined, butter-smooth, minimalistic (nearly stock), yet very useful Android skins, with some handy off-screen gestures, smart customization options, an excellent and improved 'Reading' mode, and Zen Mode to control your phone usage - the excellent software experience remains one of the primary reasons to consider a OnePlus phone

‚óæPerformance

‚úîÔ∏èBreakneck speeds with the new Snapdragon 855 Plus¬†(which is supposed to be about 15% faster than 855 with graphics), and fast UFS 3.0 storage

‚úîÔ∏èPlaying graphic-intensive games is¬†smooth, and the phone is lightning quick at launching and quitting apps, surfing the web and taking photos

‚óæCamera

‚úîÔ∏èGood, versatile, triple rear camera setup, almost identical to the OnePlus 7 Pro¬†- the only significant difference is that the telephoto lens, while packing more pixels (12MP vs 8MP on the 7 Pro), lacks OIS, and has up only to 2x zoom (instead of 3x on the 7 Pro)

‚úîÔ∏èWhat that means is that picture & video quality is also very similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro -¬†in daylight, the photos are clear, bright and vibrant with some very good HDR rendering¬†- in low light too, the performance is more than decent, and the Night mode helps with that

‚úîÔ∏èThe wide-angle camera takes bright and sharp landscape photos, and the pictures don't show much warping around the corners, as wide-angle cameras tend to do

‚úîÔ∏èThe new macro mode is good too¬†- allowing you to take pictures of objects closer and with much more in focus than before

‚úîÔ∏èPortrait shots are also great¬†- the fallout between the foreground and background looks smooth and natural, and you can now take portrait photos with the wide-angle camera as well

‚úîÔ∏èThe 16MP front camera is good too¬†- again similar to the 16MP front camera on the OnePlus 7 Pro

‚úñÔ∏èIt's a very competent camera setup for the price, but again it's not quite up to the level of the most expensive flagships¬†like the Galaxy S10 series, Galaxy Note 10 series, Pixel 3 series, or the iPhone 11 series

‚óæAudio

‚úîÔ∏èUses its earpiece as a speaker, which gives the OP7T an¬†excellent stereo audio setup¬†- it's even slightly louder than the 7 Pro - and one of the best stereo audio setups on a current smartphone

‚úñÔ∏èNo included earbuds or a 3.5mm headphone adapter

‚óæBattery

‚úîÔ∏èGood battery life with a 3800mAh battery, and a 1080p screen - you will comfortably get a day's use, even with the 90Hz display

‚úîÔ∏èAmazingly fast charging with the new Warp Charge 30T technology¬†- it charges to 34% in 15 min, and 68% in 30 min

‚óæVerdict

‚úîÔ∏èOn the whole,¬†the OnePlus 7T is an excellent, top-grade addition to OnePlus' tradition of providing top-grade flagship devices at surprisingly reasonable prices¬†- arguably its best value device in recent times - it's again the new 'budget flagship' to beat - near perfect

‚úîÔ∏èBetween this and the OnePlus 7 Pro, it will be mostly down to whether you value the curved screen and the pop-up selfie camera enough to pay the extra moolah -¬†for most people, the OnePlus 7T will be the more sensible value choice

‚úñÔ∏èIf you want to look at even lesser expensive budget flagships though, you do have some strong options now¬†- the two best value ones would be the Asus 6Z, and the Redmi K20 Pro - though you will be missing out on the super smooth 90Hz display and the great software experience of OxygenOS",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

This phone is build so perfect and beautiful, my iphone user friends are even jealous with the design and make.

Pros:
# beautifully premium design with glass back and matte but metallic looking glacier finish. I dont like motorised parts like in reno or 7pro design, feel unsafe to me.
# processor os ultra fast, finger print reader is fastest i know of, screen is mesmerising though i feel a very little difference as compared to my samsung s7 edge screen, refresh rate i dont know how to make out difference, so no point there tbh.
# price rnage is okkay. Not pricey not cheap.
# battery life is awesome, considering 90hz refresh rate and samoled display with 855+ processor.
# everything else u cna think about is pros only.

Cons:
# gboard google keyboard is okayish as compared to apple and samsung keyboards, im getting misclicks and misspelled words, accuracy is too much i think, apple has so much optimised keyboards, so does samsung, i think oneplus and google will work on it.
# camera performace is just fine in low light tbh, apple 11 will surely shot better pics in low light i think.
# i hv watched on youtube about life of back glass, they said it is prone to develop scratches over time, i dont know though, lets see.
# headfone jack was removed. My heart broke, its not a good movement, we have senheiser and all 3.5mm headfone jacks, why r u removing these guys, its basic thing, shifting from micro usb to type c usb plug is different thing, but this is not at all fair, we are forced to buy third party connectors which practically ruins the atmos effects, many of us dont like wireless. Thumb down here. As a gesture of goodwill you could provide connector in the box at least, yeah its not there in the box, buy from outside.
# no colour option for 256gb version as of now, only glacier blue, not a big issue, but its a bit funky.

Pros-
-camera quality is superb
-warp charging is a boon for me, after full battery gets drained it charges up fully in 30 mins. Can u believe it? It works consistently.
-with battery saver turned on battery comes for 2 days with basic usage (calls, WhatsApp, browsing)
-speaker audio quality is good
Cons-
-i couldn't realize how the 90 hz refresh rate improves speed and performance. I couldn't find any difference from an MI phone's.
-only USB c port for earphone. So have to buy a Bluetooth earphone or the unreliable c port connectors.
-double tap to wake up the screen is not working for me

1. Display is bright and no problem in reading even in outdoors. Scratch resistance is impressive. I am not using any tempered glass or screenguard and I don't find any scratches till now.
2. Battery is impressive and quick charge is really quick about 40-45 mins for full charge.
3. Processor is best, no lag ,no hanging and no heating isuues even with heavy use.
4. Audio is decently loud and clear.
5. Camera is the best part of this phone. Back and front both cameras give awesome clear pictures. I will try to add few samples here and you can judge by yourself.

Pros :
The speed. The. Display. The snappiness. Warp charge. Macro mode.

Cons :
The battery will last just about a day. Not great but warp charging makes it up for it.
Camera : Let's be honest it's not the best in class. But it's really good in terms of capturing the fine details. Macro mode is specially top notch.

Oxegen OS is brilliant, everything you need and no bloatware. The screen is big, very clear, and ultra-smooth due to the fast refresh rate. Not rated as waterproof but it can take a dunk and keep going. Looks amazing, very good build quality. Warp charge is the best fast charging tech out there. 0% to 80% takes about 15minutes.

The bad: no wireless charging. Pictures are a bit too crisp making things look a bit surreal. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is not as fast or as accurate as of the dedicated scanners from the last generation. But once that happens, the phone is very good and fast. Even wearing a hoodie with sunglasses it will pick me up.

Overall I would recommend this phone for people who watch a lot of videos, play a lot of games, or run multiple apps often. Not for people who take a lot of selfies or care about having the absolute best camera on the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews

The battery life could have been better, comparing the rivels.  The worst flagship phones that had weaker battery performance have resolved this issue, but I wonder why OnePlus did not see it as a concern. I have bought this 7T after having used Redmi Note 4 for 2 years; I have had premium smartphones in the past, such as iPhone 3Gs, 4, Samsung Note 3.

I am totally happy with the performance with the only cons being an average battery life.  Redmi's battery was overwhelmingly good with a decent performance.

I am using battery saver option during work so that I have enough juice left till I reach home. The Warp charger is a saviour.  With battery saver option, I am able to sail through the day to bedtime.

The call quality, speaker and signal reception are good even at basements and underground metro stations.

Oxygen OS is close to stock android and snappy most of the time.  Additionally, OnePlus is offering free extended warranty for 1 year for all its customers having models from OnePlus 6 onwards, which is a great marketing strategy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

I noticed mainly 3 things that may concern buyers.
1. Form Factor- The size and weight of this phone is too big. Even if I have bigger hands.its impossible to use in one hand. You will get used to the weight but when u pick up other devices u will feel OnePlus 7 pro could have better weight balamce. It may pain a little if u are lying down and watching any video for a long time.
2. Battery life - on paper 4000 mAh battery looks good.but it's battery back up is average. I am getting little more than  4 Hrs screen on time. U can increase the battery by turning off 90 hz . Buts what's the point of turning it off while 90 hz is the reason u r buying this phone.
3. No always on display- Coming from Samsung phones I really miss the always on display features. Thought it has ambient display but u can never see notification unless u touch the phone. Don't know why OnePlus did not give this feature. At least give a option to turn it on or off.
Now let's talk about advantages of this phone.
1. Display- oh boy.u can enjoy this beauty of display all day long. Quad Hd 90 HZ amodled display is stunning. Once u use 90 hz other phones will feel slow and that includes iPhone too.yeah u heard that right.
2. Sofwtwere experience- oxygen Os is so close to stock Android and in some cases it it better. Buttery smooth animation and super quick Android updates makes it one of the few devices having Android 10 at the time I am writing this review
3. Sound Quality- This phone does have a decent dual stereo speaker which gets very loud. Audio quality is great also has Dolby Atmos support.
4. Haptic feedback - I did not think earlier vibration  motors are to be considered as an advantages. But this phones vibration feedback is precise and strong. U will feel joy typing on this phone for sure.
5. I was sceptical about this phones camera because many reviewers said camera is the weakest point of this phone. But I found the main 48 mp sensor as good as S10, iPhone 11 level. Though it's secondary cameras lacks behind those flagships.  U can tweak the photos little bit and will get excellent result. One plus nighscapeobe is brilliant. Better than Samsung's night mode.
6. Performance - Snapdragon 855 and adreno 640 is more than capable of heavy tasks and gaming and this phone is no exception. Never faced any lag. That's it.

Verdict- The pros overweights the cons by very long margin. If u can manage the weight or size this phone will bring a smile on your face.

Secondly, the camera is good enough for most people, but in low light, unless you use nightscape, the pictures are bad, otherwise the camera is very good (not excellent) in bright light scenes..
Also, the battery is quite nice actually, but the last oxygenOS update ruined the battery life tbh, now it barely last a day, i have to recharge it again by the end of the day, to about 50% (the charging speed is really very very good!! Very fast charger indeed) but i last about 15-20% everyday by the end, PLEASE DO NOTE THAT I USE MY PHONE A LOT THOUGH, üòÇüòÖ SO IF YOU ARE A LIGHT USER, WHO CASUALLY USES YOUR PHONE, YOU CAN EASILY LAST A DAY EVERYDAY ON THIS PHONE, I USE ABOUT 6-7 HOURS EVERYDAY, SO THERE'S THAT...
If u still want a better battery life, you can always turn the screen to 60Hz or maybe even lower the resolution from the settings to get better battery life...
Also the screen is just amazing on this phoneüòçüòçüòç it's just mesmerizing to look at!!!ü•∞ü•∞

The speed with which the page opens with your fingerprint and apps switches happen, the clarity and quality of the videos and the ultra loud but crystal clear speaker sound can beat many phones of better range any day. You can bet on it. The Samsung S series like curves at vertical edges of 6.67"" large screen and no bezels gives the phone very rich looks. By far the best OnePlus till date.

The 4000 mAH battery lasts throughout the day with more than average screen time but the charging is again super quick (30 to 100% in less than 20 mins)

Using gestures feels awesome and gives more screen space on already a very large screen.

Camera is still under testing so no comments, however initial pictures looks very good.

But this review is coming after 8 months usage of One Plus 7Pro. I had One Plus 5 earlier and so I thought of going with 7Pro. I would say this phone is no match for the earlier version. This phone hangs a lot and updates are pathetic. Seems like One plus is trying to do too much on this phone or something is wrong that they are not able to fix.  Though it iss said to be their fastest phone but I find non reason on why it hangs or freeze.

After using this phone my confidence on higher models is shaky. So don't go with the wave of impressive advts. Check for the real user reviews.

Camera was better in One Plus 5. You need to edit the pics clicked indoors to make them brighter and colourful.

Battery life is just okay but you need to keep your brightness in control.

Design is good but that's not the only thing that you would buy an expensive phone for.

If with 80GB storage space as balance it starts lagging or freezing then what happens if the you are low on space like 10GB. It was almost unusable when it was that low on storage. I had to clean it out. So even if you buy a 256 GB phone just make sure you have enough storage left.

This is my personal view and points. Use your own judgement and knowledge to evaluate the phone.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

A lot of issues with One plus 7 Pro...
1) Ghost touches- the touch screen acts wierd sometimes and apps open up and closes automatically.

2) Delayed Response- while making calls, there is quite a long delay one I click call option. Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.

3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.

4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.

I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.

Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may.

UPDATE: Editing the review after using for more than 6 months, haven't faced any performance issue so far. Performance is top notch till date & now same device getting sold at 10k discount, so it's good buy.
----------------------------
Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here's all in one review:
Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few days.

Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.

PRO'S:
- OnePlus 7 Pro's DISPLAY looks damn beautiful üòç with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.
- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.
- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.
- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.
- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.
- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.
- Cam2api enabled.
- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.
- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.
- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.

CON'S:
- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.
- Overpriced.
- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.
- Device is heavy.
- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally üòõ.
- No wireless charging.
- No headphone.

FINAL VERDICT:
- If OnePlus 7 Pro satisfies your requirement, buy it though it's little bit overpriced but still worth it.
- If not 7 Pro, Samsung S10+ is also great choice.
- Otherwise, if looking for low price phone, Flagship Killer 2.0 coming soon üòú

Note: I'll update review, after using for few days.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

Personally, this phone was way out of my budget, so I used the HDFC debit card (zero payment) EMI. I still have 2 months left on it, but I don't regret this decision one bit.
The phone is built really well and the pop-up camera has an incredible 'reflexes'. Meaning if you accidentally drop your phone while the pop cup camera is open, the phone detects this and immediately shuts it before the phone drops to the ground.
The camera is superb- both video and still. The landscape wide-angle lens is almost at par with the iPhone 11 (I did a comparison with my friend's). The slo-mo video camera is pretty good too. The phone also has an inbuilt video stabilizer. The quality of the video deteriorates in this mode, but in a well-lit environment it's still great!
The phone charges really quickly, from nothing to full in about 2 hours.

Two downsides to this phone are that the finger print recognition can be a little annoying. It doesn't always recognise the fingerprint instantly. And the other is the mic for capturing audio. I'm a musician and sound designer and I thought that this phone would give me almost iPhone like audio recording, but it's way off. It's a long time before this phone can reach to where the iPhone is in terms of audio recording.

All in all, a great phone. Super fast, can play any game, run any app and stream any video smoothly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

Even than lots of reviewer have tested in water so did I & product seems to work fine without any issues .
Despite of having such a beautiful display & 90hrz power pack performance there isn't any tempered glass for same which I can protect it with .
Upgrades & updates have been consistently improving without any delay or lags.
Pop up camera seems to work perfectly great knowing the fact about limited numbers of move ,insipite of same there have been lot of safety measures for force movement incase occured at time in pocket . I wouldn't suggest to use face unlock more often as the under display scanner is the best in it's class & most freakingly smooth.
Glass back is litle bit scary at times as now we have to protect the front as well back of the phone ,for which I use the default case provided by OnePlus themself .

Shipping this phone has been a night Mayer for me as amazon weren't efficient enough to deliver the product to me on time ,as sum issue with there shipper & loss of good .which was a surprise to go through .

Overall it's a good experience on the handset side ,since there's nothing better than having a 90hz refresh rate & such a powerful performance.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

But I found some things really disappointing.

1. Battery- Though the battery is a 3800 mAh (li-ion) battery it isn't sufficient (lasts roughly up to 4-6hrs of usage. Plus there is slight heating issue temperature rises all the way up to 42¬∞C and an average of (37-39¬∞C) that's kind of a heating issue for me. OnePlus could've used the traditional li-po batteries providing a range between 5000-6000 mAh battery capacity just like Asus ROG did so that the temperature remains constant.

2. Camera bump - the slight camera bump in the back also kind of annoys me because I feel it might get scratched even if I use it with the hard/bumper case.

Other than that I really LOVE the phone especially the 90hz refresh rate at this price point is super cool plus OnePlus now are considering to improve their camera through software updates and it keeps getting better :)

This phone is really a masterpiece. What a build quality, what a camera, what a surround sound, what an amoled screen, what a great software optimization of Android. It is impossible to find a phone with this level of performance in this price bracket. I ordered it the moment it launched and never felt it was a wrong decision. 400000, 256 GB. What else you want. Now my phone has double the Ram my laptop has. Do you belive that? The 90 hz display is awesome..Great job oneplus as always. Keep it up.

Just onething you should change. This  phone is not a mid range phone. So, please make sure to put a headset inside it.

7T should have been the only product launched by OnePlus instead of 7 & 7pro!
What a phone it is!
Processing speed 5/5
Camera 4.2/5
Look n Feel 4.8/5
Performance 5/5
Lags 0/5
Charging 5/5

Highlights:
90GHz screen refresh rate is something that's puts OnePlus 7T in the league of the iPhones and the S10.

Cons:
Nightmode could have been better!
Not upto the mark of Pixel and even iPhone 11
Battery could have been 4000mah, but still 30T warp is a mind-blowing deal.
Memory slot could have been arranged.

Wow factor:
30T üòò
Telephoto lens üòò
Configs 8GB-128 combo is sufficient

Now, coming to comparison with iPhone XR and iPhone 11, personally I would prefer OnePlus because of flexibility, Android ecosystem provides to the users.

Verdict:
A perfect benchmark from most of the parameters.
Performance wise is a SHOWSTOPPER!!

Should you upgrade from 7 to 7T -NO, save your money.
From iPhone 8 or Below to 7T -Yes",5.0 out of 5 stars,,

I am now thoroughly familiar with its functions, and we get along well. The battery has stabilised, and I get 25 to 30 hours easily with around 9 hours on screen. The phone lights up on its perimeter when in lock mode and you get a notification - different colours for different apps. I have given it full marks now as it has surpassed my expectations. I thoroughly recommend this phone and consider it to be great value for money! Please hit like if you found my review helpful and let me know in the comments your experience with this phone.

___

This is a preliminary review after one day's usage and exploration. It will tell you how I feel about the phone and how I perceive it when comparing it with other phones I have owned. Please remember that every person is looking for different things in a mobile phone so your user experience will be different from mine.

My wishlist included honest photography and videography with a clear yet deep sound, long battery life and a front fingerprint reader. I take lots of pictures and hate the overexposed, oversaturated and beautified images that have taken over the market, hence the need for honesty. I had a few phones in mind and kept watching videos trying to figure out which one would suit me best before ordering the One+ 7 Pro. The reason? The photo tests came really close to those of Google Pixel 3 and sometimes surpassed them!

So here are some observations I noted down as I got to grips with my new phone:

Comes with silicone case but no earphones or adaptor. Guess they expect us to have leftover earphones and adaptors from previous phones?

It's large and heavy! Consequently, it gets cumbersome and causes muscle fatigue after a while (had a similar problem with Sony XZ3). I preferred the feel of the Mate 20 Pro as it was slightly slimmer and fitted better and also it was beautifully balanced, so you did not need to exert yourself to hold it. [My hand has gotten used to its weight, but I still feel a bit intimidated by its size and wonder whether we do indeed need such big screens. However, watching Netflix in bed demonstrated the beauty of its large display and the clarity of its sound.]

The fingerprint reader works well and fast. Facial recognition is also speedy, but as it requires the recessed camera to work, I am not too keen on using it.

Photographs were a bit noisy on portraits but looked artistic. The update fixed the noise issue BUT ruined the portrait mode that is now overexposed. Not sure why; still figuring it out. Need to test it further. The rear camera produced good photographs compared to the Mate 20 Pro, which was a fail. The S7 has more depth of colour, and a nice background separation which gives photos a 3D appearance, something the Mate lacked and the 7 Pro cannot quite achieve. (The S7 was a dynamite phone despite the skin smoothing.) [It was my stupidity. I thought like a Galaxy S7 user that if I click on the face of the person, I'd get an AF lock, but this phone has no AF lock. What it does when you click on the part of the screen is giving you the option to adjust the exposure (light or dark), so I ended up with a washed-out picture - my fault entirely! Also, in portrait mode, it has a little oblong shape that says Depth Effect. This is what controls the bokeh, and you can't do much about it other than make sure it lights up green before snapping the shot. It will light up green only when the camera is at the correct distance from the person. I suppose this is one way of making sure the subject is in proper focus. Talking of the bokeh effect, it is very subtle, unlike other phones. If you want stronger effects, photo manipulation programmes are your friend, but for me, this is good enough.]

Videos on the One+ 7 Pro are beautifully stable when walking, but if you turn fast, the image blurs momentarily before it recovers. [I enjoyed using slow motion but not sure if other phones can switch to slow motion during videoing or if the YouTuber vloggers actually splice videos up to add the slow motion part. My phone can take either or videos. The slow-motion does not activate randomly as in the Samsung phones, and I think that gives you more control but, to be honest, I am still a rookie in these things.]

Sound playback is excellent in music and films due to the top and bottom speakers, but the microphone can hardly pick up someone talking 1.5 meters away from you in a quiet room when you are taking a video.

The display is not as great as any of the comparison phones. The icons (phone, texts, camera, etc.) are not as beautiful as the competition's. There is a poor selection of wallpapers and none of the themes. One thing I enjoyed about the Mate 20 Pro was its wide selection of wallpapers, some of which were animated. Felt so excited to hold a phone that had falling cherry blossoms. Luckily, the Play Store has a variety of free wallpapers and was able to find some that give me joy. [Once a great wallpaper was in situ, everything looked much better!]

The curved edge makes the letters from some apps seem to slide downhill, reminds me of Salvador Dali's famous melting paintings. Not a deal-breaker but distracting. App developers and One+ should take that into consideration and condense their displays to leave a black gap on the edges when text is involved. [My brain learned to ignore it.]

The bottom navigation bar lies behind ads in games like Solitaire - takes some skill to NOT click on the ad trying to get to the home screen, and I am proud that I have mastered it. [Should not be a problem if you are not using the silicon case. If you do have the case on as I do, learn to start the scrolling action from the silicon itself, and you won't miss.]

Angry Birds Friends is not loading and constantly crashing. [Uninstalled the app as per Rovio's instructions and re-installed it. It worked until I exited. Then I was again unable to load it. This morning, it works again. Mystery!]

Bejewelled Blitz was jumpy despite the 90 Hz refresh rate, and it feels laggy. Taking off the Fnatic mode seemed to improve things a bit (though Fnatic is meant to be ideal for gaming...) [Checked this morning, still laggy at 60 Hz even if all other games are closed. I can understand the screen being slow because of the screen protector causing more friction, but why is the game slow to load results? Maybe my broadband is slow at times?]

Colours on apps seem ‚Äòdirty‚Äô instead of bright and vibrant as in comparison phones. Also, blacks look greyed out. [I got used to the new look of colours, and it does not bother me any more. I have even reduced the display settings to save battery as that is more important to me at the moment.]

Google Calendar is more laborious to work with than the Samsung calendar as it requires to select what kind of entry you are entering - ugh! (Ease off, Google. Just let me enter it and trust me to know what my entry is for!!)

Step counter kept counting up despite me not taking a single step. It just felt the vibrations of me picking the phone up and thought this was walking. Hmm... to cheat or not to cheat? [I don't really fancy walking around with this big phone, so I have left my old phone in the bathroom LOL]

I did not use the file transfer app they recommend as I had a bad experience with Huawei's own and never said again. Sadly restoring from Google backup, did not restore my text messages. The other phones did, which is baffling. [Apparently, Google security does not allow a full restore unless you verify it is you who logged in from a new device, so do that first and then try the restore.]

The keyboard is more accurate than the Samsung one, probably due to space, but it makes it more tedious to type as you need to move your finger further. However, it has a great feature: a proper keypad that can be activated entering a series of numbers. On the minus side, the special characters are slightly harder to get to.

The final observation is that the battery seems to drain fast (very steep slope in the diagram). The battery charges fully in 1 hour 20', and despite predictions that the phone would only last till 3 am, the phone survived the night on standby mode till 6 am. Although the screen was on for about 6 hours yesterday, I didn't do much other than set it up, take a few pics and a couple of short videos and try out my game apps. The Mate 20 Pro had an amazing battery life. [The battery continues to worry me. If I need to be charging it more than once a day, then I have gained nothing over my old phone. I have now put the phone on a dark theme, reduced the Hz from 90 to 60 and lowered the resolution. I also make a point to close every app when I am not using it. I am now confident enough to say that if there is a deal-breaker for me, it will be battery life; however, apart from the 6T, most phones have worse battery life. The Mate 20 has a great battery, but the photography is ... ugh! I will try to let the battery drain and then charge it early morning and see how it fares. With light use, I would have expected the battery to last more than 23 hours :( Imagine if I start using it exclusively as I did with my S7!]

Conclusion: I am not 100% convinced this phone is for me though I can learn to live with it. I know from reviews that the One+ 6T has much better battery life and photography so maybe that would be an option...? [I am so tempted to order it and compare!!!]

I have just uploaded a screenshot of the battery information. It has improved. The phone goes into panic mode at 15%, but if you ignore its message, it will see you through the night on standby and give you a couple of hours light use before it truly needs recharging.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews

Before purchasing the phone, my main concerns (based on other reviews) were the camera and the notch. My previous phones were of Sony and Google, so the camera on the OnePlus 7 is not upto the mark. But that is probably the only downside and one that does not matter a lot to me personally. And the notch is a bit annoying -I have opted to 'Hide the notch' in the Settings.
Amazing battery life- 7.5 hours of screen time & quick charging, gameplay experience is great, best speakers on a phone I have experienced (sometimes a bit too loud).
On-screen fingerprint reader is very good but it does struggle when the phone is on a table - i have to pickup the phone in my hand to best position my thumb.
The phone, both the rear and the screen, is very prone to fingerprint smudges. Holding my old Google Nexus in one hand and the OnePlus 7 in the other hand, I definitely feel the OnePlus to be more 'sticky'.

Here below i have put some point about the One Plus 7 Pro (8GB RAM +256 GB storage) after using about 20 Days. I hope this will be informative for you.

Pros

1) It looks very stylish and slightly curved display is added beauty of this mobile.
2) Display/Screen is large and give ultimate movie/video Experience
3) I did use the 1+ 6 earlier as well so comparison to that it's far better than if i compare the sound quality. it Gives 3D sound effects
4) Vibration intensity is quite good
5) Charging speed is good, But to get the 100% charge it takes long time
6) Rear Camera is very good, But Video/Image stabilization is less than one plus 6, and slow motion video requires high lights, capturing motion object is not good. but wide image capturing and day light shots still will not disappoint you.
7) Front camera here is pop up camera so according to me for the selfie you do not need to clean Everytime... so i like it personally
8) Storage is enough to handle your data
9) Data transfer rate via cable or Wireles is fast, But also produce heat
10) Finger Print is OK, I will not say bad but its not lightening fast
11) overall it's good product will not disappoint you when you will go for this

Cons

 Hardware is strong but there are some software problem which i face i will mention here... its not a show stopper but One Plus need to look into this.

1) If you remember one plus 6 that gives alphabet reflection  ""S"" on its glass panels and it was added style... but One plus 7 they didn't provided that kind of reflection.... i am not happy with that
2) No accessories like earphones with the box
3) I purchased type C bullets earphone from one plus but it is not smooth to insert and move out from type C port
4) Pre applied screen protector there is bubble in curved corner.. So i think  it will not work for me for long time :(
5) Now come to the software isssue
- Screen Auto Brightness is not well tuned
- Rotation sensors is not work well some time you need to slap the mobile to work the same :(
- Rotation sensors not works for all mode of example if you are looking some file from the file manager  and you want to horizontal look into that so that will not work
- Supposed you have opened the WhatsApp and suddenly call come then you will not able to who is calling and what number its you need to click on that
-When call is active in SIM 1 you will not receive mesg on SIM 2 , I faced this issue many time i used to disconnect the call to get that message
- When i put my mobile in pocket and when i move out from my pocket it says to many wrong or incorrect Finger attempt kind of message.. so I guess may be pocket sensors is not there or i have not enabled some settings on it
- There are many other software issue i observed which i faced i dont want to make this post lengthy by this so moving next
-Screen recoder should work in background, but here it gives dot symbol, So what if i want to record activity on my mobile in hidden way ? there is no option
6) Cover is good fited but to charge the mobile you need to move out  the plastic cover from type C port but after using 20 days shape has changed of that and its not covering any more type C port, then why they haven't cut that piece which is almost unused. its very annoying to see that piece

Note : These above software issue points should not stop you to buy this product... These are minor problem that can be rectified by newer update

and i want to appriciate and wish good luck to One Plus and it's team for this product. Such a nice product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews

Cellular Network Problem - Main purpose of phone is not served. Frequently gets disconnected from cellular network. Can't call anyone. And if anyone calls, they will get hear a voice message that phone is switched off.

It is not the problem with cellular network. When I keep the same sim in another phone, it works well. I tried few times by keeping the sim in another mobile. It has the problem only when kept in OnePlus 7 Pro. Tried resetting the phone. But problem persists. Had to erase the data and reset the phone already 2 times in the past 1 month.

2. Oneplus Pro launcher is a basic one without high-end futures. I kept Nova Launcher Prime. But in this phone, Nova Launcher Gestures will stop working after every 24 hrs. I need to reset them again and again.

This phone is overrated.

Here is my review. I bought this phone after using iPhone 7 plus and Vivo NEX. Everyone here is writing about pros. But I will write about cons.

1. UI - there are too many issues with software. For example it has gesture navigation option. But trust me. Its use less. You will be back to old school navigation key after few hours. Every one use mobile case these days. And it is very hard to use those gestures with case on. Also it conflicts with many apps. You will not be able to open menu of any app due to these gestures. Vivo nex has this feature but they implemented it very well.

2. Battery - It has only 3800mAh battery. You may have watched many videos it is enough for 5-6 hours. Trust me it's not. I am getting only 4- hours SOT with very normal uses. Update - I lost 2% battery while writing this review.

3. Charging - Oneplus says it support 30W charger. So let me come to reality. I Compared this phone with my old vivo nex. And I found 7t charges at maximum 3450mA (checked with Ampare app). And Vivo nex with has 23.5W charger charges at 4100mA. Don't know why any YouTube didn't mentioned it.

4. Camera - The thing I liked about camera is just macro mode. Every thing else is still below average in this price range. Front camera and portrait mode is even worse than my 3 year old iPhone 7 plus.

Fingerprint, facescanner and performance is perfect.",3.0 out of 5 stars,,

PROS:
1) Display: Display is buttery smooth. 90Hz display gives you a smooth performance.

2) Battery: Battery is not so bad as it is being said by reviewers as it is giving me around 1 and half day of battery life in aggressive usage. I play heavy games a lot like pubg and Call of duty. And still the performance is nice.

3) Camera: Believe me the pictures coming out from this phone are perfect. I am a professional photographer and i am pretty impressed by the performance of the camera.
And the videos are also good and so are slomos.

4) Sound: Stereo speakers of this phone are insane. I have used many stereo speaker smartphones and i am telling you the speakers from this device gives better sound.

5) Charging: The phone charges from 0-100% in 60-70 mins. What else you want now?

CONS:

1) No 3.5mm jack as you all know. And the company is not providing any 3.5mm to type-c connector.

2) No IP Rating. However, the company said that the phone can bear water splashes but the certification is what makes us comfortable.

3) No wireless Charging. The device has a glass back but then too there is no wireless charging.

But these cons are not a deal breaker.

Note: At this price range OnePlus 7T is a great deal. Go for it blindly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews

Have been using it for almost 4+ months. 90Hz display is amazing and smooth (one of my favourite these days). On screen fingerprint is fast enough for unlocking the phone. Unfortunately, i didn't used face unlock and i didn't use front camera often. So no comments on that.
With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company's claim and its working excellent so far).
Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.
No troublesome heating issues found so far.
There is no headphone jack, but i don't have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).

The phone has the latest processor in the market (as of now) so there is no compromise in terms of speed and processing.  These are the Cons that came up while I was using in this  in the 1 month of usage.
1:  The screen does not turn on with the Double Tap, and I faced this problem very frequently then you have to press the power button to make it  On.
2: Though the fingerprint scanner is very fast some times it fails to recognize the scan, there you have to manually enter the passcode to unlock your phone.
3: In the initial days the battery back up was really robust, after almost 2 weeks then battery started draining very fast even though I did not play any high-End games like pubG.  Asphalt etc,.
4: On a normal day for the minimal usage of apps like 5 to 6 calls in a day (1 hour of calling on average) and spending an hour (on an average screen ON time ) of whats app and Instagram, apart from that phone would be idle for the rest of the day. For that, the battery drained so fast from 100 to 17 percentage in the time period of  10 hours (No Background apps running ).
5: And also I've personally experimented about the battery draining rate, I kept the screen on and left the phone idle without any background apps running. The battery drained 1% of it for the screen on time of 2 minutes with No apps running in Background  (approximate).

I can say the phone was good initially, The problems came up very slowly. If you want the phone with good battery life, I can say to give a second thought before buying .",2.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-608/product-reviews/B07HGBMJT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Everything is buttery smooth and fast. Coming to the fingerprint scanner it could be better because sometimes it takes time to read. Face id is fast, although i have nothing else to compare it with but still good. And camera to be honest is actually good and night mode is little bit sumdgy somtimes but still captures good night pictures. Video recording is the best i gotta say, it is very stable. The only problem i found about the video is the 4k 60 fps mode, the file size is so large it is actually impossible to record more than 10 mins which would probably take about 10gb of memory. The front camera is also pretty decent. Coming to the os its one of the best i have used and all the apps function very very smoothly. If you are planning to go for iphone in the same range i would recommend to go for oneplus 7 pro since its a much better buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_75?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=75&reviewerType=all_reviews

As the Notification LED is not available in OnePlus 7T, it is very difficult to understand the Battery charge is full or not do we have any new message in the inbox etc.
2. Each time we need to touch the phone to know these things.
3. The notification for may of the APPs like Azan, IMO calls etc. are not working properly due to some advance level of battery saving. As switching off all the battery saving options, still the notifications are not working.

I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.

Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.

I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.

So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews

Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few months.

Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.

PRO'S:
- OnePlus 7 Pro's DISPLAY looks damn beautiful with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.
- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.
- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.
- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.
- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.
- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.
- Cam2api enabled.
- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.
- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.
- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.

CON'S:
- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.
- Overpriced.
- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.
- Device is heavy.
- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally .
- No wireless charging.
- No headphone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-604/product-reviews/B07HGLBZ5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_168?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=168&reviewerType=all_reviews

After spending a day going from one shop to another to have my sim cut and everyone saying it was too small already, I found someone with the same phone, and they opened their sim card tray and said mine was defective.
What kind of pathetic service is this?!
This has not only made me not want to shop for anything on Amazon, but also has made me hate the brand OnePlus.
OnePlus's call centers are also not customer friendly.

Here are the things I liked and disliked:

# Display is Great (but its glamour goes away after putting on a back cover, which is necessary as the phone is too slippery without it üôÅ)

# Camera is not that great if we see it from the price point. I was using OnePlus 5T before this and i feel i had a better camera setup. Also, I don't know why nobody is talking about the Portrait mode of the rear camera, it automatically zooms the image 3x, making it hard to take portraits of a nearby people/objects. Also, zooming 3x makes things very shaky and hard to take a steady shot. Really not satisfied with the Portrait mode's auto cropping zoom. Similar issue was there in OnePlus 5, the first OP phone having a dual camera setup, but the issue was resolved in 5T.

# The next big thing that no one is talking about in the reviews is unavailability of Notification LED. This is seriously a big turn off for me.

# Battery backup is decent considering the screen size and display quality.

# The phone is too slippery without a cover. The phone attracts a lot of dirt and is also a fingerprint magnet.

# The company should have provided a better back cover and Type C earphones (or at-least the Type C to 3.5mm jack converter) within the box at this price.

# I also purchased the OnePlus Wireless Bullets 2 separately. Their sound quality it's good but there is no sound feedback received (the connecting beep sound that you get after long pressing the button) while using Google Assistant via the button on wireless bullets. Even my wired earphones provide that feature.

Overall its a good phone if camera is not a great deal for you. Though the OnePlus should have kept the starting price of this phone under 40k. Instead of wasting money on advertisement and making big celebrities their brand ambassadors, the company should stick to their original vision of providing flagship killer features at an even killer Price tag.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews

Since now I have not faced any lag issue or app crashing issues. Below are some detaied feature i want to mention.

#OxygenOS and Fnatic mode :
 The main advantage of this phone is smoother experience with the 90hz display and Oxygen OS. It runs on the latest Android 10 version. The Gaming mode and the special Fnatic mode is very useful gor me. It activats advanced DND mode and blocks calls, notifications, messages and enhances the RAM  , CPU and GPU and also enhances the network speed.

#Battery life:
The bettery life is not that bad or good, but average. For me as a student it lasts about oneday for single charge . I can play a full game of PUBG mobile on this divice and it drains only 12-16% battery . But the charging speed with the Wrap 30T is insanely fast. It almost charges my phone from 15% to 80-85% in less than half an hour. If you continuously watch youtube videos , it will give you about 7-8 hour of backup in 90hz , which is great I think. If you want more battery backup you can use it in 60hz.

#Camera quality:
I don't think i need to say about that. You can check the photos i have taken . The low light mode is awesome.. And a super awesome feature is the supermacro mode. It can focus objects near to the camera of about 2-3 cms. The pro mode is really awesome, which allows you to shoot photos in different types of ways. I have to still explore the various camera mode options üòÖüòÖ. Many people don't like the camera bump and the round camera design. I was also like that but after using for 5-7 days I am used to it and I don't feel it bad.

#Sound quality:
Sound quality is also good compared to the previous edition (OP 6) of my friend. Now it comes with dynamic sound quality with Dolby Atmos.

#Warrenty and updates:
Oneplus gives android updates for about 2 years and security patch updates for 3 years . I have got 1 year warrenty . Then i got complementary 1 year warrenty extension by downloading OnePlus care app and registering my IMEI ID no. Overall I got 2 years of warrenty.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews

Display- the best display on any smartphone!
I saw the good reviews on this mobile's display but damn! I didn't expect it to be this good!, I have a S10 in my home for comparison and I can surely say this is as good as Samsung's

Build- I waited for nebula blue and it's worth the wait! It looks awesome, build quality is excellent but a bit hefty but manageable and u will get used to it in one day

Camera- this is the main part, I don't know whether it's due to my low expectations on camera due to all the negativity but I'm genuinely surprised with the camera, even for this I compared it with S10 and it's pretty close to S10, low light photography is a major improvement and it's on par with S10 which is considered as best in low light other than Huawei
So don't believe all the negativity, I wonder people who are putting negative review are using DSLR for their daily photo needs.. the only negative would be the wide angle lens is not upto the mark and the one on S10 is way better
Very happy with the camera..

Battery- way better than my 5t and easily getting upto 7hrs of screen on time with moderate to heavy usage and warp charge is the best!

Performance- no need to say specially about performance coz it's OnePlus!
855 with 90hz display, the fastest phone in the world!

Others- call quality excellent, sound output via Bluetooth excellent, fingerprint sensor excellent, vibration feedback excellent, no ip rating but totally waterproof.

Overall an excellent package and it's worth the premium price!

Important note: 3x telephoto lens will not be active if the object is at less than 50cm distance from the lens and in very low light scenarios in such cases the main sensor is used for zoom for better quality...",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

To begin with,
Pros  ,
1. The phone is very fast since it is equipped with latest Snapdragon processor 855.
2. The finger print scanner is very fast and accurate.
3.Face unlock features works accurately all the time
4. Fast charging (Dash charging) can charge phone from 0 to 100% within just 1 hrs and 15 mins . It also gives pretty decent battery life.
5. Since it is AMOLED display , the  clarity is outstanding.
6.camera clarity in daylight is good
7.Being an audiophile , I should say the sound which is coming out from the stereo speakers is loud and crisp, even better than any other phone with stereo speakers like Apple X or Samsung S10 . One can fine tune according to their taste using Dolby Atmos.

Cons,
1, Camera's performance in low light is not so good
2, Lack of 3.5mm audio jack is a big miss where some other phone brands with similar features manage to put one but of course , one can use type C to 3.5 mm converter or Bluetooth headset.

Overall it one of the best phone in the market .One who is looking to buy one can blindly buy it , I can assure you that you won't regret it",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-611/product-reviews/B07HGMLBW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

This time i have decided to go with one plus for first time, and belive me,it was a fantastic decesion.
Previously i am avoiding other mobile brands ,only for displays.But this time one plus hitted a bulls-eye.Thanks to great display.
I am amongst first few members to buy this master piece,as soon as it has launched and i have taken full 20 days to evaluate this mobile to write this review.
As promised,delivery of mobile was superquick by Amazon.I have received this mobile,even before it was released for regular customers,and available on retail outlets.Thanks to Amazon.
This mobile is overall a very good package. Display of this mobile is fantastic,with crisp and clear pictures.Though samsung displays are little bit superior,but margin is very narrow and for day today work,margin is absolutely nil.This displays donot oversaturate the images and pictures.
Battery life is fantastic and last for entire day easily with heavy use on 60 hz QHD setting.On 90 hz it is little less.Battery life is definately far far better compaired to my Note 9.
Camera quality needs some improvements, but i am sure that one plus will definately rectify it in upcoming updates.Already,a update from one plus has improved camera performance drastically.
Mobile is little overweight and big to handle for average sized hand people,but it is matter of just getting ""used to it"".Once you get used to it,you will definately enjoy using this mobile and watching movies on it.
Sound quality is crispy clear and battery backup is also very good,even if you use blutooth headsets.
Fingerprint reader is fast but still needs some improvement...
SD 855 Processor is superfast.No need to review it,as this is fastest amongst all mobiles,i have used in past.UI is very good,and you can adjust it according to your needs.
WRAP charging is fantastic.You will get decent battery charge within 15 min of charging this mobile in emergency situations,though it will not be required in day today practice,as battery backup is fantastic for mod-heavy users,as stated earlier.
I my opinion,compairing price to performance ratio,this moble is the best mobile to buy to date.
So ""JUST GO FOR IT"".
Now ,I became a proud fan of one plus.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews

This phone camera doesn't have 16:9 mode, so watching them on TV shows unused black screen (this is a major use case for most of us).
I am using Nikon D5300 DSLR for almost 5 years, but occasionally want to use a good camera phone for family pictures. So, in that hope, i purchased this phone.  But when we compared some photos taken from iPhone 7 & this phone on Sony Bravia android 4k TV, iphone 7 photos/videos seemed much more natural and pleasant than this phone. I tried to use Google Camera as well as oneplus Pro mode, but still unable to beat iphone 7 in terms of photo quality. Obviously, iphone 7 doesn't have telephoto & wide angle cameras and have lower pixel rating. So, I believe iphone XR must have much better quality.

Other features of mid range phone is also comparable at much cheaper price (Samsung m30s, Redmi Note 8 Pro, Realme XT have very similar features), so whats the point of this hyped oneplus brand.

Also, I am not gamer, so a phone within 6"" display is much more pleasant, but still went ahead with this heavy & large size phone (6.5"", forget to operate it from single hand & more seems like carrying a tablet all the time), just for a good camera sake, which is also not up to the mark.

Now I have stuck with this phone, as Amazon & oneplus has only replacement policy in India, but these same companies have 15 days refund policy in US & UK (so much bias towards India, where they sell most of these units). There has been only 3 days, since I received this phone. If anybody interested in purchasing it, I can give it away at reasonable discount.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

While setting up the phone with data transfer from old phone felt the temperature was high even though there is liquid cooling system. But then it's only one time process and never felt the heat later.

Used Asus, which is pathetic in network services. Recently I broke that phone (out of frustration) and was waiting for k20 pro. And when I saw that old touch, sound, camera, advertisement etc issues in their review, I bought this one plus 7.
It's nothing like I have used before,
Pros:
1. The OS s is awesome, light and fast.
2. My office colleagues tested the camera and all of them came to a conclusion that it's the best that they have seen. And mind it, they are all smartphone freaks. Their review means a lot.
3. The phone is fast as light. Thanks to SD 855
4. Looks of the phone is simple yet premium, and it's build is quite stardy.
5. It's sorround sound system is worth it.
6. It's heptic touch engine is extraordinary
7. The days are gone when only sumsang phones made the best display, this phone has a very good contrast. Won't compare with the costlier ones, but the best in this price range.
Cons:
1. Expected at least a punchhole notch instead of a teardrop one. Don't know why they didn't do it.
2. They could provide the wide angle lense for camera as well
3. Battery backup is about 1and half day, could be a bit better.
--but what we are getting can still give shame to any other flagship devices...
One plus has shown once more that they are the flagship killer.

Top notch phone... Does it have some bad things in it.. Yes.. But for this price that wouldn't even matter to you. After using it for 4 months I'm writing this review
Amazing display.. The picture quality is amazing. Videos, Gaming and other things have become simply more than just entertainment.
Body is so... Just to say frankly sexy. When you hold it in your hand you just know that you are holding a really cool phone.
One plus processor is again taken to next level. Though not as smooth as 7 pro but still will give it a run for its money.
The best part is I guess speakers... It is even louder than some bluetooth speakers itself. Even without the earphones it doesn't ruin the video experience.
The camera is also good. But I expect that minimum standard from one plus. Though the night mode is a child when compared to 7 pro. If you are looking for a phone mainly for photography I would suggest one plus 7 pro rather that this.
The fingerprint reader I felt is less smoother than one plus 6 and 6t but still its not something that bothers me..... at all I mean.
Battery life is leaps and leaps better than all the previous ancestors. It lasts one full day with rigorous gaming too. Battery saver mode really saves the battery too.
All the heavy games work in this phone on max graphics and 60 frame per second. Gaming is really smooth with no lag.
No earphone jack point for 3.1mm pin. You have to use a Bluetooth device or buy a earphone with C type pin.
Overall I'm really happy with this phone. It's a really cheap price for such an amazing phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-611/product-reviews/B07HGMLBW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros:
1. Great built quality, which matches with other premium flagships in the market
2. Best part is its display. Large 6.7 inch mesmerising oled display, with gorilla 5 glass n notch free design. Beauty to watch
3. Loud n crystal clear speakers
4. Fast warp charging
5. Super fast performance with latest snapdragon 855 processor, faster ROM, n largee RAM options

Cons:
1. Little on heavier side to hold at 200 grams
2. No 3.5 earphone Jack, USB C to 3.5 adaptor n earphones not provided despite this high price point

Battery will last over a day with moderate use, and at FHD+ it will last even more. Camera is good, if not the best.

You will fall for the screen itself.
Bought on amazon prime sale on 16th and got it on 17th. Super fast delivery by amazon. kudos.
Coming it the phone, it came with the pre-applied screen protector and a transparent case. That's a good welcome gesture. This is my first OnePlus phone coming from a stock android phone. The OOS is clutter free and experience is pure smooth with 90Hz and QHD+ resolution. With that in mind, the SOT of the phone with full brightness will  hardly reach 5 Hours. I use this preset in home as, thanks to warp charge, which charges in 1 Hr 10 min from 0 %. And when I go to office or any other, I use the FHD+ and 60Hz preset to get almost ~8 hours SOT with medium to high brightness.
Basically this is a gaming phone. So you can play PUBG with no lag at all, also maxed out settings in Call of Duty Mobile.
Camera quality is very promising. I used Gcam to get almost as good as pixel like shots. Day light shots in stock cam is better than GCam. Except for the consistency across the cameras. I hope OP will fix this issue with an update.
Finally I would say that, this mobile is totally worth it for the price you pay.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews

Have been using it for 5 days and here are the pros and cons-
Pros-
+ 90 Hz display
+ really fast charging in 30 mins it hits 70 %
+ Oxygen OS, having used Redmi phones this is much more smooth and definitely OS wise this feels more premium
+ Macro mode is just great with really indepth close object clicking
+ Gaming and Frantic mode - This has been there in other phones as well but is worth a mention
+ No heat up issues till now - Played Asphalt 9 and COD for 3+ continously but didn't heat up
+ Super fast face detection and fingerprint sensor

Cons
- Image stabilization while clicking pictures was an issue sometimes
- Battery lasts about 14 hours but with such fast charging its a non issue for me
- The camera notch but it gets solved as most of us put cases
- Colour options are only 2
- No Memory card slot with very high resolution clicks your memory will get over very soon, wpuld recommend you buy a 256 gb one for 2k more and not make the mistake I did
- Earphones not included in the box. While I don't have much of a problem with removal of the 3.5 mm jack, it should at least be compensated with USB C or bluetooth headphones

Finally, the cons are not many and pros really outweigh them.

Final rating - 4.5
Verdict - Go for it, at 38k its a steal",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews

Always loved their product. Then switched to one plus 3T which I loved even more. Still both phones are working perfectly fine.

I decided to upgrade to one plus 7T and was hoping to love the whole experience. Contrary to my hopes, phone is not as good as what company claims it to be.

1. Phone lags a lot despite having a good processor and RAM. Though I never faced this problem in earlier models of One Plus.

2. Facing problems with fingerprint reader as well. There also it is very slow to read my print.

3. Only good part is camera which is excellent.

I would only give it 2 stars out of 5, that too because the camera is amazing.

Main reason for sticking to Oneplus was there software support over long term. Oxygen OS is veey snappy combined with best hardware till date.

The performance difference between OP3 and OP7T is very big. I was comfortable with performance of OP3 till i started using 7T.
Web page rendering,animations are very fluid(maybe due to 90hz refresh).

Design wise i like narrow ergonomic design.It is confortable for one hand usage though it is slightly heavy. Buttons are very tactile and clikcy.
The alert slider is much better compared to one on OP3.

Camera is good nothing exceptional.

Speakers are very good for media and call.

Display brightness is slightly low, could have been better.

I don't like the notch. It ruins overall experience.
Most of the time it is hidden in black bars and most video playback don't support notch(tested in Chrome,Amazon Prime).
Moreover video content is very limited for this aspect ratio as of now.

Battery life is average. Same as three year old OP3.
If you are heavy user and always on the go,then it may not last till evening.(I always keep 90hz on,else what's the use of paying for such feature.)
A bigger battery is definitely a miss here.

I really miss 3.5mm jack. Bluetooth options are convinient but not good as wired earphones.
The price/quality of Bluetooth options is way below wired earphones. You will have to go for ANC bluetooth headsets to get decent quality audio experience.
I have ordered type c wired earphone to see if it is any better.

Overall a good buy for the price. I hope they don't raise price further into Samsung/Apple range.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews
