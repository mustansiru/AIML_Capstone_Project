- Display is fabulous!
- Speakers are extremely loud and audio quality is amazing!
- Cameras take great pictures! Much better than I expected at this price point.
- Performance: SD855+ and 8 GB RAM. Obviously it has blazing fast performance!
- Warp Charge 30T

Cons:
- Battery life could've been better, but Warp Charge 30T makes up for it for me at least.
- No headphone jack. Welcome to 2019! :(

Note: I was going through some of the other reviews written by people. Some people are giving less stars because they didn't receive the ""big box"" which they saw on YouTube which is stupid because that was a review unit packaging sent to reviewers by OnePlus 8-10 days prior to the launch. Obviously we don't get all of those things. Also, someone wrote that we get a Warp Charge 30 charger, not 30T inside the box. I'd like to clarify that both charge at 30W, the difference is just in the way they charge. We're getting 30T charger in the box, don't worry.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

You'll find the appraisals elsewhere because honestly you know it's a great phone for the price. So I'll write about some of the technical issues I faced over time. Maybe it's not the same experience with everyone but my OnePlus finds it difficult to adjust the auto brightness mode by itself. It's so annoying at times.
Fingerprint sensor is okay but not as great as Samsung's.
Camera should have better software. Guys chant about pictures like DSLR's and having awesome blur effect but neither google can flawlessly blur background except for simple selfies or objects like a Rubik's cube or a flower taken in macro. These technologies are developing and I hope future OnePlus version will have proper camera algorithms.
And guys if you prefer wired earphones because they don't run out of battery or better value for money, then sorry but these phones don't come with 3.5 mm audiojack and they are not currently selling the type c to 3.5 mm converter even on official OnePlus store. It's been out of stock for months -_-

I used oneplus X then bought oneplus 3 and then oneplus 6t an dnow oneplus 7 and year by year oneplus is improving and they are growing and prove their tag line 'never settle'.... I am using this phone since last 2 weeks and have no complaints.... Though I feel that camera can still be better but it does well. It's not a camera centric phone either but at this price it's somehow expected to have superb camera .... Some camera samples I am loading here. Battery life is normal, lasts full day... Dash charger charges fast but takes around 1 hr to charge fully .... Zero lag in day to day use... I don't play any games though.. Use cast feature a lot, listen music, use Bluetooth (Tantra wireless) a lot in car as well as with bluetooth earphones (Tagg inferno 2.0 wireless earphones) and ai even use my wired earphones sometimes via Type-c to 3.5mm adapter (bought separately, by Sceva brand) .. I mentioned these products here as I wanted to clear that phone is compatible with accessories of other brands as well and has no issues at all.... I bought blue colour and it's stunning and eye catching... Just loved it.... The mirror finish is damn good.... Oneplus did a great job in releasing blue variant.... The protective Case included in the box is superb... I accidently slipped the phone from my hand and it fell down on brick surface but thank God the cover saved the screen as well as body of the phone from any kind of scratch ... The screen suffered no scratch whatsoever even after falling down so badly with face down... Though I got 1 year complimentary screen replacement with phone for whole one year.... But the Case provided is a saver 😊👍.... And best part is its transparent and the blue colour looks good through it.... How can I forget that the phone as usual comes with pre applied high quality screen guard..... Go ahead with it friends.. Best in this price segment..... Screen is great, touch is awesome, fingerprint is good as usual.... And now the best part... The stereo sound.. Believe me it's superb.... I have watched movies and even played music over the speakers and it sounds great... 2nd Best change made by one plus, 1st is blue colour ..... 😀👍

This is not a paid review friends so pls give it a thumbs up if I helped you in deciding for this product.... 😊 👍",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-611/product-reviews/B07HGMLBW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_401?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=401&reviewerType=all_reviews

Box useful things: Phone, charger & wire, sim ejector, phone cover & preapplied screen guard.
Cons:
- There is no C type to 3.5mm jack in the box which is very disappointing and more disappointing is, its not even available not in retail store or Online store.
And none of the One plus customer care have any idea when it gona be available. Now i become sitting duck with my expensive 3.5mm headset. If you buy third party converter you might have multiple issues like microphone won't work. Giving 3 star just for this.
-Finger print seems little less reponsive sometimes may be because iam keeping the preapplied sticker.
-Battery backup is okay i say. For Full charge you get 26 hours battery life. In which 9 hours usage and remaining stand by.
- Charging- It took 20minutes to reach 40% from zero and 30 more for full. Expected little more speed.
-Phone overheat one time by simple Hotspot, app usage not even playing game. There claim of remain cool is wrong reducing one more star

Pros:
-One plus switch app helps the 80% phone migration easier.
-Display is good
-Camera is better for this price range. Low light is good
-Speed is awesome
-Face recognition is cool. It even respond well with phone not facing you properly which worries me also.

Overall iam happy but headset jack sh*t me.",2.0 out of 5 stars,,

The closest competition - the dilemma was should I go for the pro and pay 53k or the standard version and be done within 35k or so. Both have the same heart and soul. However, a waterdrop camera is a weird prospect. That, and only that made me choose the Pro. But when I got the Pro, I realised that the screen that came with it was just fabulous. I have never seen something like this and I will not see this in any other phone this year.

The real flagship - Now that I am ready to shell 53k, it made sense to rather weigh the alternatives. S10 is the obvious answer but that punch hole is a turnoff for me. And again of all the features that S10 has that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks, headphone jack is the only one I miss. Oh, and did I tell you about the screen on the Pro.... It's gorgeous!

The backroom - I have always believed that a product is a reflection of how the company thinks. Behind every great product is a group with high standard of ethics, skills and the never settle attitude. Beside Apple, I have found that in this time (June 2019) companies like OnePlus and Honor (Huawei) are frontrunners in their products as well as their vision. So go for their products. Honor does have better camera.

The new OnePlus 7 Pro lacks in camera. It's the only area it lacks in. But I see promise in the brand and future updates will make it better. I believe it. The battery drains faster when you play video games or watch videos. I found my screen on time to be close to 5.5 hrs with 16% battery remaining. 20% of the time was spent on PUBG, 15% on Google Play services and a combined 20%+ on videos. I found it quite underwhelming. However, once you take a break from your phone and go for lunch or a bath, you will be surprised to see how fact it charges. 0-100 in an hour. In fact plug it in for 15mins and you will see a 30% increase in charge.

Everything else works like a charm. The fingerprint sensor is great. The first few times will be erratic but then it gets accustomed to the user. Works fine from there.

The sound quality is almost great. It is loud but I wished that it was a tad bit better.

The Oxygen OS is doing its job as we speak. It is so natural that you might not just feel that it's not stock Android. It's very close it the stock. And it's nothing extravagant. Oxygen OS is just right...

Overall, rating here
Build 9/10 just for the lack of official IP rating.
Camera 7/10 I have taken better pics from phones that cost half. Pop up camera is good.
Display 10/10 can't explain why. You need to see for yourself.
Charging 9/10 This thing is a monster with Warp charger. And I don't need the wireless charging.
Processor 9/10 Blazing fast. Took away a point because there is always room for improvement.
Value for money 8/10 the phone is great but the camera could be better. As a user, I am very satisfied. I would rather hold OnePlus 7 Pro than the Samsung S10+.

Nominating the Pro for the best smartphone of 2019.

there is a red / green tint issue at lower brightness levels. i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it. other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and OS.
but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable. although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue. please beware before buying this. check this thing the moment your device arrives. get brightness below 40% and see if there is tint on dark grey / black backgrounds. if there is promptly return it. because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

Though most of the features were available with other flagship phones and at a much cheaper price I went ahead with Oneplus thanks to my flawless experience with OP5 for 2.5 years.
Coming to the performance of the phone, the standout aspect would be the 90Hz refresh rate. The phone just seems to run so much smoother than its competitors. Other aspects would be the camera (obviously), dash charging(which definitely improved over Oneplus 5 and the aspect ratio of the screen which is just perfect. I feel the phone is heavier than the previous one I have used but this is not an issue at all.

Performance is very good and smooth, though I noticed it hanged while running WhatsApp and gallery once. May be some software issue.

Display is superb. Without 90hz refresh it's working flawless and I did not notice any benefit of using 90hz refresh setting so to me it's more of marketing gimmick or may be it's more useful in high end games which I haven't tried yet.

I bought it after comparing it with k20pro, op7pro and iPhone 11 and I am satisfied with its performance so far.

Without wasting any time I will come to the relevant points:

HIgh's:
Smooth and fast due to good processor
UI is good, near to stock android
Screen looks pretty nice

Mid's:
Camera is average, phone disappoints a little bit on this front considering this a flagship phone.
No front flash
Does not look that premium may be due to colors available or the overall thickness of the phone.
Security features had issues initially but they have fixed this up in the recent patch.
Low's
Old Notch design, not future proof. Should have been punch hole atleast if not pop up camera.
Looks heavy and it is
No 3.5 mm jack
No earphones with the phone
No USB C to AUX cable
Size could be little smaller( this is a personal choice)

Final verdict - Phone is good for the price, you wont regret buying this. There are very few phones available at this price point with this configuration.  Personally, had i not bought this 3 days back, i would have gone with Honor 20/Pro for the same price but better design, and better configuration.

But it sincerely lags in Camera department even after updates. Video Recording, Voice Recording are great but i am not sure for some reason pics from its front camera just looks average and lacks true colors. Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it.

I never had a oneplus device before. After using it for a week I came across these observations :

Battery life is superb, and warp charge really packs a punch. Does 45% charge in around 15-18 minutes.
Fingerprint reader is lightning fast.
Rear cameras will make you forget Dslr. Low light photographers can will find this amazing. Front camera is perfect. The device is a little heavy but flaws are less when compared to other advantages. 90hz refresh rate is a boon. Actually you have to get a hands on experience as words will fall short for this beast. There is no question of lag. PUBG and other games are smooth and well the graphics is on another level with the gaming mode setting. The fluid AMOLED screen is pure joy. There is no audio jack but that's wierd  but if you can shell out 50k for a premium device then you can afford to shell out few extra bucks for a Bluetooth headset. Still going through the device features as everyday I am coming across new features which is really cool. Mirror grey looks better those who can't buy the nebula blue, go for mirror grey, you won't be disappointed.
Overall the device is a beast. Go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews

  Build quality is really good as with any modern flagship smartphone.and a fantastic display to compliment excellent build quality. I would say the best display OnePlus put to a smartphone since it's inception. Colors are vivid and punchybut not as oversaturated as Samsung. Camera has been improved a lot. 48MP main camera does a good job in good lighting condition. Although the inclusion of ultrawide camera is a welcome addition the quality of the photo you receive from this sensor is not on par with the main camera. It s
is to be expected since it is using much smaller sensor than the main one. But the two photos using these camera is Stark contrast with one another. It is the same story with telephoto lens as well.
 Fingerprint sensor on this smartphone is an under disply optical sensor, although this technology in paper will sound good but in practice the technology is not matured yet and much slower than the capacitive one we used to.
 But one area this smartphone redeem itself is the display, the 90hz display in the OnePlus is one of the best display in any smartphone right now. It is an absolute delight to use in everyday.
 Then there is software. OnePlus's skin on smartphone is the best other than the stock Android. It is smooth and highly responsive and overall much better experience than the other manufactures tend to do with their software.
 In summery it's a looker of a smartphone that has some great features display and software experience among those and some so-so features like camera and in display fingerprint reader.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros

• Phone is really fast and works really good
• Awesome camera and gaming performance
• This phone does the justification for it's price tag

Cons
•  If you are looking for a gaming phone than go for ROG 2 it has 120 hrtz of refreshing rate which is out of world.
• Big round camera design is something which is not everyone's cup of tea.
• You have to use this phone very carefully because it's not that tough.

Also the Worst after service brand.,Reviewed in India on 4 December 2019,"This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T , first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device , this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can't help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing , they checked my phone and they told that it's just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back , then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it's not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side , so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I'm just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare.
Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don't buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

Nice features and specs loaded into the phone but lot of software glitches. The Work profile is the biggest put off - once you to turn it off, there is no way you can turn it on unless you hit the factory reset. I am surprised that this issue which is bothering many users is floating since Dec 2018. Looks like we gotta see oneplus forums as well before heading out to buy a oneplus phone. And sometimes Whatsapp hangs up; cannot ascertain if this is an issue with Whatsapp or the phone, though. I have been a big fan of OnePlus and was a die-hard user of the One and 5, but this is disappointing stuff in the 7.  The overall look & feel, the display, sound quality, and camera sharpness are outstanding as they always are.

I charge the phone and use it hardly for 3-4 hours in whole day keeping Mobile Data On throughout still it manages to stay at 10-15% by 24th Hour.
But Warp Charger won't let you down ✌🏻
Best at audio output both wired and wireless!
Video enhancement is implemented very well.
Do buy it when it's available for ₹34999 with UAG case to protect your phone. I have no idea and trust on other cases to protect Oneplus 7T as the back panel is made of glass (you can refer to durability tests on YouTube, to get an Idea about what I'm trying to say about the protection).

If you have budget to spend 36000 rupees (which will easily be used for 3-4 years so ROI is pretty cool) either in single payment or through EMI. I suggest to go for it. Its a great phone in the price tag.

Once a smart person said : You cannot go wrong with oneplus and I felt the same way.

Hit Features of the phone :
The 90Hz display is a delight to work with.
Camera.
The software(it's as important as the great specs a phone offers)
Smallest notch.
Audio quality.
Premium looks and feel.

Shortcomings:
Sab maaf..!!

People are complaining about it's battery life. Though it's early to say but it has a pretty decent battery backup and fast charging is again what makes this phone a strong buy.

No it is not fair to compare the two models but the pathetic quality of M30 with network signal and connectivity issues, it definitely is not worth 14k+
Coming back to 7T, there's hardly anything negative noticed after a week of usage. Camera is top notch, low light shots are excellent, battery lasts more than a day even with maximum use of mobile data and WiFi.

Highlights:-

1. The camera performance is mind blowing, you will be amazed with the camera shots and night mode. The pictures barely need any after edits if you want to directly post on Instagram.
2. Charging is super fast. No complains, phone is ready for use in half n hour.
3. Overall performance, RAM management, storage speeds, oxygen OS, 90hz display is as usual very good. Refresh rate is definitely noticeable to me but it depends on person to person.

Some negatives:-

1. The slightly disappointing thing is the battery performance which is just average. It has improved quite a lot after recent updates but not extraordinary.
2. The display is awesome but it might appear too bright sometimes, need some sort of feature to lower the glare sometimes.
3. Fingerprint reader is fast but not the best finger detection.
4. A major problem for one who has small hands is that the phone is very tall.

Camera - No doubt, this is best one for camera. i tried taking pictures in every light(day, night, afternoon) and believe me this stands par from others. Didnt want to carry DSLR for my travels hence landed up at this. I am fully satisfied.

Fingerprint sensor - Bit slow but pretty much acceptable. This doesn't mark phone in negative side.

Battery - It ran for more than a day for me. I clicked around 50 pics, saw 10 videos, did setup of numerous app in this phone after one time charge and still it ran for more than a day. So, i am happy with that.

90/60 htz - I shifted to 60 hts and performance was good enough.

Charging - Fastest ever seen.

App opening time - Very fast, impressive.

Memory- I can see 256 total available memory. So its not like other phones which shows 223 available out of 256 GB.

Sound - Excellent. Enjoyed playing videos on YT and Savn app.

Earphone Jack - Bought a type C converter from local market(Pimpri,Pune) for INR 80 and it did the job well.

Body Cover - It looks like a normal cover. Doesn't hold mobile tightly. I would change that to a better one soon. I see some good covers are launching on 20th October for INR 599. They looks superb and rigid.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

  2. Ui speed awesome
  3. Charging speed mind boggling.
  4. Haptic feedback best in class.
  5. Sound quality of speakers awesome
  6. A big thanks for the speed of phone.

CONS: 1. Poor battery backup (battery drains rapidly)
  2. Camera just an average (it kills originality of photos, make face a bit pinkish.)
Don't know when one plus camera are going to justify it's price.
  3. Handsfree/Bluetooth earpods sound below average. Didn't expected this from one plus.
Tried different components handsfree /earpods same result.
  3. Weight management very poor.

The fingerprint reader is good for an on screen reader, but might take a few tries to open at times. The face recognition is on point and really quick. I even tried the drop-test where the pop-up camera automatically closes in case the phone is dropped. The back cover and screen protection provided in the box are of great quality and can definitely be used. The Nebula Blue colour is a real gush of fresh air, and has great finish and look. Overall I am really satisfied with my purchase. The only disappointment was that the company doesn't provide us with any earphones or a type-c to 3.5mm jack adaptor, which should have been a compulsion provided type-c earphones are not that easy to find, and this phone is a premium range phone and should come with these basic requirements.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-604/product-reviews/B07HGLBZ5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_168?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=168&reviewerType=all_reviews

I am writing this in grief that the product which I received is malfunction and I tried to return this product on day 2 of me buying it , but as per your amazon policy money was not refundable . Is it good to take people hard earned money and become rich with all this schemes , before amazon was never like this . You can check call records even I have contacted your company executives not once but twice. Days passed and it the 16th day of this phone the phone has an issue as when I using an app like watsapp while texting it opens the profile of the person whom I am texting , plus it opens up the the other app . I don't know what problem is this . I urged your executive even that mamm I don't require the money , I would be ordering iPhone XR but then also she said a clear no . Experience WD one plus flagship phone is getting pathetic with every passing day.

Pros-
1. The display is absolutely amazing 90Hz refresh rate makes everything make more fluid, plus the HDR support is a good feature since they are tying up with Netflix to bring HDR content, although some apps have not used the curves at top and bottom of the screen properly.
2. The phone is fast and I mean damn fast, thanks to the Qualcomm SD 855.
3. Battery life lasts about a day with medium use, with heavy use with QHD and 90Hz kept on, the battery drains fast. But  with the WRAP30 charger it charges pretty fast.
4. The UFS3.0 storage is very fast.
5. The phone design looks good, one of the best looking smartphones with a glass back.

Cons-
1. The biggest con is it has no headphone jack AND no USB-C to 3.5mm converter or USB-C headphone is provided with this, so you have to shell out extra bucks for that.
2. The upcoming OnePlus 7 still has SD855 and 48MP processor, although it costs about 32999.
3. The camera is nothing unique for a flagship, but still captures good photo even in lowlight.
4. No wireless charging.
5. No official water proof rating.
6. It's very slippery due to the glass back, so if you've tendency of dropping phones definitely get a cover. Although finger smudges are easy to clean on it unlike the Google Pixel.

Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..
Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage.. It depends upon your usage..
Camera : I don't take selfie or photos that much, so can't comment on it..
Performance : It is really really fast..
Sound : I do watch a lot of my content on YouTube i do feel the speakers are not that clear.. They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)

My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..

Pros : As per my usage..
#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..
#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..
#3 - Performance is really fast..
#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)
Cons : As per my usage..
#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..
#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)
#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash.. (It may be the choice of app i may use)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews

Being a premium phone, the One Plus brand did not pay much attention on primary camera. The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.

Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.

The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter. The One Plus should take up this feedback and include the one in the pack.

I had a Manufacturing defect on my device. Which is a Display issue. Yes the much proclaimed 90HZ display !!! The screen had a gradient shade (as in the photo attached) which is more visible during night time when we have the dark mode turned on and are on some greyish background. The brightness level has to be less than 30perc.

As I failed to DISCOVER this within 10 days of purchase, oneplus denied Replacement/Refund.
Many others are also facing this issue- Go to Oneplus community for more details on this issue.

So far Oneplus has not been providing any sensible response. It's been almost 15 days and my phone has been in the service center with status "" Indefinite Delay"" due to unavailability of spare display. Feels like I have been ROBBED by Oneplus.! :(

I WOULD RECOMMEND TO STAY AWAY FROM PURCHACING THIS PHONE.

Overall satisfied!",Reviewed in India on 22 May 2019,"The most expensive OnePlus phone yet and they definitely have done a great job. The moment you look at the 90FPS AMOLED you are above to fall in love and also will be main selling reason of the phone. It definitely beats iPhone xs in terms of performance and the smoother animations certainly helps. Gaming on this amazing display is a delite and all the games works really buttery smooth. OnePlus has also improved the haptic feedback on this device tho it can not match the level of iPhone but a good change is always welcome. The phone has its downside however, first the camera. I don't see any major improvement in the camera after coming from OP 6 I still feel its kinda the same although OP has this time around went with completely different sensor. Photos from the main sensor are great with great detailing tho falls in low light situation. The telephoto lens doesn't perform that great and found images to be washed out in most scenarios tho a software update can hopefully fix this. Finger print scanner is quick but it sometimes won't recognize the finger no matter what. Battery life isn't that great but with moderate use it can go for entire day of usage. Speakers are a much upgrade from last OP devices which is now stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos on board. Speakers however do offer decent feedback and can get really loud if thats what you want.

Pros:
Boy oh boy that display!
Performance is top notch and is certainly the best performance phone in the market today.
Price; considering how expensive phones have got lately I will say OP7 pro packs a lot and will certainly make users happy.
Oxygen OS - I would prefer Oxygen OS over stock Android as it offers much more than what stock has to offer without losing the minimalist charm. Oxygen OS always have provided on top time software updates which is a pro in itself.

Cons
Camera's could have been better.
Fingerprint scanner doesn't work properly sometimes.
Speakers could have been better.
OP should at least provide earphones in the box considering the price they are charging.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews

Consider someone very important calls you and this situation occurs. I lost couple of my business deals because of this

Visited customer service centre (80 km away from my home town) more than 5 times
1st visit : Without entering any case sheet, they told this is a software issue and flashed the device
2nd visit : Collected the device and after 6 days they return said motherboard has been replaced ( Have service summary ticket with me)
3rd visit : Entered another service ticket and after some days they cancelled the ticket (Have service ticket number with me)
4th visit : After begging them they entered another service ticket and now it is almost 8 days. In all these days I called their customer care almost 20+ times and sent emails more than 15 times and now they are saying they can't diagnose the issue so collect the device after 5 days and after that when issue occurs submit it again.

There is a problem with the audio. Sometimes after a voice call or video call, audio doesnt switch back to loud speaker, it still plays through ear piece and you cannot hear anything. Only solution is restarting the phone.
Also while using whatsapp, sometimes the phone gets frozen and again you will have to restart the phone.While making video calls through whatsapp, multitasking is disabled and when you try to switch the whatsapp chat during whatsapp call, phone hets frozen.

1. Phone & applications hang/freeze anytime - have to restart it again to continue smooth performance.
2. Average camera performance. Night mode is great. But the camera never focuses accurately whenever I switch from wide angle to normal or even macro. Under normal lighting conditions, the primary camera performs well.
3. Battery drains quite quicker than expected but yeah thanks to warp charge. 40 minutes and I am back to 100% from 5%.
4. Call quality is not up to the mark as the audio is extremely low in terms of volume.
5. Stereo speakers are very loud and that's a plus point. However there is inconsistent sound distribution through earphones (I have tried many earphones on this and the observation is constant)

The phone does have its pros and cons. Im writing the review for people who are thinking of buying this.
Pros:
1) Snapdragon 855+ processor with 90Hz of refresh rate means the phone doesn't lag or hang. If it does check with the buyer. Most people on amazon dont check the buyer and end up crying foul.
2) Finger print and face unlock its really impressive with the speed.
3) It has a customized Oxygen OS and that works pretty well with the kind of customization the brand has put in.
4) Design and the matt finish gives the phone a stylish look.
5) Battery life is really good. I have almost 300 plus apps and I easily use it for a day or two with all the surfing and writing mails. The warpt charger charges the phone somewhere between 30 to 45 minutes.
6) Dolby speakers and colors of videos bring it to life.
Cons:
1) Doesn't have a ear jack and the brand doesn't provide an earphone which is pretty bad as a user is paying close to 37k to 40k.
2) I thought the camera is ok. They could have done much more with the quality. Tag disappointed with it.
3) The phone did heat up initially raising a concern but over time it hasnt been that bad.
4) Not sure about the quality of buttons and lastly they havent officially mentioned anything about waterproof and dust proof.

Overall its a good phone. Hope it gives a bit of insight for people who want to buy this phone.

But has poor build quality especially the back panel. I was using this phone with OnePlus case provided in the package and after using for 4 months, noticed a small crack near vol button and crack started developing. Mobile is not dropped at all.

I visited the customer service and they told it's a physical damage and not covered in warranty. This back panel cost 2k and 400+ service charges. So ₹2000 worth back panel is so brittle.

But all that enthusiasm and expectations died down within 3 weeks, since my screen got damaged in an unusual way. The phone offers 90Hz Refresh rate with a very good display but at the cost of a risky design. I see this as a design / manufacturing issue which one plus is not ready to accept.

The worst part is the Customer Support team and Servify (One Plus Care team) teams who are very unprofessional and change their stance every minute. I was initially told that the screen will be replaced since it was just 3 weeks after purchase. Later I was told to purchase a 1 year Accidental protection plan which I did at additional cost. After purchasing this plan they said, I will not be covered for various reasons and the plan will be no more valid. I had to wait for one week with multiple calls and then shell out 12,000/- Rs from my pocket to get the screen replaced. The Ad says Screen Protection (Pre-filled)...god only knows what this means. I am duped really with the worst customer service team of One plus.

Yes while the phone is very attractive with lot of great features...do not forget the quote ""All that glitters is not Gold"". Keep this in mind before you shell out 35+ k to buy this phone.

My only hope now is Amazon since I have reported the issue to them and hope they will do something to reduce the pain I went through.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.

90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)

Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.

Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.

Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.

My favorite retarded reviews :

Mostly I used my phone for taking photos, calling, browsing and handling office works. I liked Oxygen OS. it awesome (like Android one + additional features). And high-end performance (High-end processor + 8 GB). 90 Hz display is good. So I gave rating 3 stars in one month of experience.
Negative
1. Camera # 2-star rating.
Landscape + sunlight (12+48) -  Giving very very poor low-level performance, I expected. Producing high boosted images (a Mixed form of colour+ contrast + sharpen) and autofocus also not giving better performance. (I uploaded a sample image taken from back camera without any edit). Night group photos are good (Mostly ppl won't take photos on the night, it's the rare case).  
2. Heavy weighted, body size and round camera body - It not comfort for men's pants pockets. Default to care for the camera.
3. USB C type to Jack 3.5 audio - Very small size and expensive item. (It's free with Oneplus 6T) 
4. Then they are changing prices day by day. I expected Oneplus to have brand value. It's will reduce the goodwill of the company soon. I think all Chinese devices have the same quality. 
Conclusion - Better to take Google Pixel. Mi phones are also good for photography. But hardware quality is not. I won't promote OnePlus 7t. Please don't trust youtube comparison video makers. They are promoters.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Just cannot ignore the missing led Notification light. If it does not come back in the next one plus phone, I will look for any other brand which has it. The phone is big and unwieldy. To pick up every time to check for messages etc is not practical. They should have given a notification led.

Update after 2 months use.
I am leaning more towards my One Plus 5 because of the notification led which is a major missing feature in the One Plus 7.

Fingerprint reader - maybe fast, but the full screen flickers when you access it. Disturbing at night
Camera - Nothing great, would love macro mode
Battery Life - keeps going down, really don't know what is eating it
Haptic Feedback - My one plus 5 has better vibration than this
90hz - Hardly noticeable
Pros - Nothing that sets this phone apart from any previous One Plus. I was happier with my Op5.
Cons - Apart from the above, heavy, unwieldy, doesn't sit well in the hand.

Before this, I was using Samsung S8 which never hanged in 2.5 years, though the processor had become a slower over the time.

But this new OnePlus phone has already hanged multiple times.
Camera quality is nowhere near the premium phones. Leave the premium phones apart, Oppo provides better camera phones in 10K. The phone is also very heavy.

OnePlus is fooling the buyers with new marketing techniques. Looks like, it pays to the famous gadget reviewers to over hype its products. Its performance is like any other chinese phone. Display colors are also not upto the mark.

Now they have also started dropping the prices.

I highly recommend the OnePlus 7pro and writing this review so it might help others .

Pro-
1) Screen - Best Screen so far on any phone and with 90Hz refresh rate it is best mobile to play games with . I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.

2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.

3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.

4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.

5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.

Cons :

Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.

Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .

Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.

Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.

Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .

Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.
OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.

Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews

But there is a major flaw in the phone- the pop up selfie camera. Suppose, you have kept the phone in your trouser pocket, with the pop camera downwards. Suddenly, a friend of yours makes a video call to you. Then, automatically, the pop up camera will come out, even if you pick up the video call or not. Then, if there isn't sufficient space for the camera to pop out fully, the motor inside will fail and your front camera will never come out. Now in that case, you may not be able to claim warranty since this would be an user made damage. I bought that phone and realised, it was my biggest mistake. Secondly, I noticed that the finger print sensor was not at all secure. Suppose, you are sleeping and you have some sensitive content in your phone which you want to keep as a secret. Then, anyone can use your thumb to unlock the phone and have access to all your personal data. I am using iPhone XS Max and believe me, nothing is as much secure as the Face ID.

The fingerprint sensor is awesome but you need to update your fingerprint data time to time to get the best experience. The camera quality is good not great. If you are just want good photos just go for it but you will not get those mind blowing photos and the low light performance is good but in nightscape mode you will experience artificial colours and lighting. Battery takes 45-50 mins (approx) for 0-100%. But battery life is not that great and yes you will find a lot of bugs in this phone. The build is fabulous and will feel like a premium phone in hand but as the rear camera is bulging out, it gets scratches. The selfie camera is good not great. The performance of this phone is really great and you will definitely love that 90Hz display but it is not a 4k display. Coming to the point, should you buy it? Yes, definitely if your budget is 40k max and u want something which is really fast and features packed. Comparing it with the realme x2 pro, if u have a tight budget then go for realme or else u should go for it and u will never be disappointed. For gaming purpose- yes this is a great device but for only gaming go for the Asus rog phone 2. For camera purpose- yes this  performs well but not extraordinary. So for camera u can go for iPhone or google pixel. But still then its a great device. The speakers, display, build, camera is worth the price u pay. Yes its overpriced by 4k-5k but still you should go for it. And yes to quote please go for the 256gb variant because the storage is enough to provide you with peace of mind.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros: Camera, faster processing with 855 and 12g ram.
90htz screen refresh rate which I can say the brightest of all models of op.  Good battery life. Can play any kind of game on this phone. High graphics. Sometimes it heats up faster but it is usual in gaming.

Cons : over priced as it contains no new features, other phone like vivo oppo and mi having similar featured phones with much cheaper price.
Heavy phone.. almost 1/4th KG..you feel like carrying heavy rock in your pocket.

Overall, if you are Op fan like me then go for it..or else you can wait for few more months for a better sleek and high config phone from OP.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-604/product-reviews/B07HGLBZ5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews

I was considering Galaxy S10 or iPhone XR but opted for OP7 for one key reason - the battery life (hope Apple & Samsung are listening). Imagine a situation where you have a phone with best features but it's drained when you want to use it during your travels!!
For me, this phone ticks all the right boxes (screen quality, loud and clear audio output, battery life, good camera) except a couple ( water resistance and screen up to 6 inches). I haven't been able to put the camera capabilities to test but other reviews seem good. Other area that I look for is durability & ruggedness, but this phone looks a bit fragile. These are the reasons for holding back one *.

Other consideration was unavailability of 5G version phones. I would rather use a fantastic mid range phone for a couple of years before moving to a 5G premium phone.
OP7 is a marvelous phone, just go for it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-611/product-reviews/B07HGMLBW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

Decided to switch to Android for functionality and my god it has been the best decision! 7T easily beats most of the devices in terms of practicality. Battery life is a little low but can't complaint because the Warp Charge makes up for it. 90Hz refresh rate makes other phones look primitive. Snapdragon 855 plus can take on any app/game you throw at it and all this superlative performance is backed by a finish that's no less than a ₹70k plus smartphone.

I had couple of major problems with this - Overheating and battery discharge. I have been with the OnePlus ecosystem since their 3 model. The last one I had was 5. And it's very very hard to beat that edition. Probably I had higher expectations from 7T. The phone overheats while you're on a video call. It shoots up to 48-50 degrees and simultaneously discharges faster than Samsung. I have reduced the refresh rate, removed the animations, live wallpaper - still it's very mediocre.

Just comparing with my OnePlus 5, it didn't feel like an update that's worth. The camera was never OnePlus's strong point and it remains with 7t. It's average at its best.

The phone's generic performance is fluid as expected, but the flaws above didn't make the cut. I have returned mine and decided to go with something else.

Cheers to those who liked this phone.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Service guys took 4 days just for diagnosis of phone and at the moment they are waiting for some hardware to repair my phone. So I settled too much with this so called Never Settle phone. You will not find it's headphone adapter even in market or their own showrooms as they want to force you to purchase a new C Type Headphone from OnePlus of course.
Pros:
1. Speed is excellent, no doubt
2. Display looks good
3. Speaker sound is good
4. Charging speed is good but do they really need such a huge size of charger. It seems heavier than my ideapad laptop charger and not easy to carry.

Cons:
1. Camera quality looks average.
2. Fingerprints scan is not quick. It's like when fingerprints sensors initially introduced.
3. Build quality doesn't gives a premium look due to plastics body
4. If you want to play PUBG or other games then always keep charger with you all the time. Battery drains up rapidly. If you just take phone calls only then it should survive for a day.
5. Like they claim their software is reliable. Well it's NOT. In my phone their Launcher kept crashing all the time. I started using Nova Launcher for a while. Later I uninstalled and reinstalled their native Launcher again from Play Store. It's very tricky to open Play Store without Launcher. Trust me.
5. Like lower quality phones. You can't rely on such expensive phones also. They focused so much on its PRO phone line up that they compromised heavily in quality of OnePlus 7. This is my personal experience.
6. Servicing Time is pathetic. They says that it happens as they have too many devices to handle. Seriously, then how come it's a Never Settle Phone if they have so many faulty devices on daily basis.
7. No headphone adapter given with phone. You will also not find in market or their own showrooms or in their website. You have to buy their C Type Headphone if you need to use headphone for any reasons.

I suggest that you should go for a better alternative like Mi K20 Pro or any other cheaper phone. It doesn't matter how much money you spent on your phones. You have to settle with them. I experienced same thing with my iPhone 6. It got repaired 3 times for faulty display.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-608/product-reviews/B07HGBMJT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

And my expectations were so high and it's been a week since got the phone, did this phone fulfill all my expectations? Let's discuss it in the pros and cons section.
Pros:
1. Oxygen OS - fluidic UI experience, the widgets are really precise and upto the point.
2. Camera - super macro is not just a specification on paper it really makes wonder. Primary camera and front camera are both best in class.
3. Snapdragon 855+ - Multitasking don't worry, gaming don't worry, WebEx meetings don't worry this guy can handle everything. Lightening fast processor.
4. 90hz refresh rate - the fluidic display is another feature that's not merely on paper. Can feel the smoothness in the display. And hdr videos are a bliss to watch in 90hz
5. Design - the design of the phone is premium I personally liked the circular camera socket. It makes the phone look like a beast.
6. Complementary pouch: the silicon pouch provided with the phone is best in quality and it enhances the look of the phone, friosted silver looks well on the transparent cover.

Cons:
Battery: it comes with 3800 mAh on regular usuage the battery last only a day and 5-9 hours, can't one plus come with 5000 mAh battery?
Fingerprint scanner: I feel the finger print scanner is not the fastest. However the face unlock is lightening fast almost no delay.

Overall: OnePlus is known for providing best user experience and it has taken miles ahead with the launch of OnePlus 7T. Despite the fact that OnePlus 7 is not real value for money, it compensated the users expectations with 7T. 7T I would say best flagship phone with 855+ processor.

Go for it guys.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews

Oneplus tinkers with Android OS to prioritise on speed. This phone would easily last someone 3+ years. The screen is absolutely stunning and the 90hz motion on the screen makes it one of the best screens out. Camera is also brilliant and takes amazing pictures. It's got wide angle lens which I absolutely love. Similar to go pro. It's also got standard lens which takes great photos on day and at night too. And a zoom lens. Battery life is also very good and would easily last a day. I never have to worry about storage since it has enough to store for over 2 years for me. Google photos backs up unlimited photos and videos for free so I don't have to always keep photos in my device. So 256gb storage is an overkill and I love it. The price of this phone is a few hundred pound cheaper than others and is better to me! You would absolutely love the warp charger. It will charge your phone to around 50% in 20 minutes. It is a lot faster than Samsungs fast charge. The best part is that it will still charge fast even if you're using the phone where as other chargers will slow it down a lot. I have zero regrets from getting this phone!

I used 6 and 6T as well, so according to my personal use of this phone below are the obeservations/review
Pros--
1. Hype, so you can show off that you jave top model of 1+
2.As compared to iPhone I found this phone better including bith price and performance because after 2 years of use iphone is also goes to same level, there is nothing extra ordinary in that.
Cons--
1. My phone (1+7)hang couple of times in 3 months , I am literally very disappointed with this but I don't want to go with whole process of raising complaint and then give them my new phone and wait.
2. I found 6T better than this, in fact far better than 7.
3. Once my phone got all blury screwn that used to come on old antenna tv and I was very worried and not sure what to do as I even was unable to take screenshot of that.
4.Phone is very heavy(that one part was better in iPhone),
5.In this price range I won't say they are giving you best what should be worth. I was expecting better product from 1 plus.Not sure if this is there testing version for 1+7T, but thsi may be a spot on one plus.
6. Worst finger sense, takes lot of time,Mi and realme finger sender is better than this.
7. Battery life and charging time that they are marketing for is also better in oppo phones that to less that what we are paying here.
As of now this is the update  will update you more.

Since I was always using iOS since 2011 so shift was a bit tricky,was a bit apprehensive about Android and yes took a while getting used to this.
But phone on a whole is not giving me any reasons for regretting my discussion.
Pros
Face unlock is superfast
Same is with fingerprint sensor
Built quality looks awesome
It gives a feel while holding it
Comes with transparent back cover
Best part WASP  charger is awesome.
Very very good response in games like pubg .. ND finally I can also see people lying in grass which was a bit difficult in my iPhone 7 ,,😁

Cons
Miss the stocks app of iPhone
Camera is not that good means it's ok types.
OnePlus ringtone is nothing infront of default apple ringtone

Overall at this price it's far better updrade then going for iPhone 11 . It wins from iPhone 11 maybe loses from 11 pro.
But it's a value for money product.

The beauty of this variant is very difficult to capture in photos, it really needs to be felt first hand.

Coming on to the device itself, it is a monster, in every way. The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:

The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.

OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.

I don't use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there. But I understand OnePlus' point of view that it is better to do it properly.

Wide angle video missing, coming as a future update, portrait mode uses telephoto lens.

It's the second day today and it just died and wouldn't start. I had about 80% battery left. I had to literally Google to check if there are other folks facing the similar issues and to my surprise there were plenty. I have used 5T and 6T both and I never faced this issue but it's completely annoying and disappointing that a phone would die like this on just the second day. Additionally I didn't quite like the battery life, even when I am not using it, the phone seems to be losing a lot of charge. The other issue I faced was I tried the smart Lock feature and used my finger print lock and also the pattern lock. The fone would automatically lock itself even when I am watching you tube or using the fone. This was like annoying to the heights. I had selected the screen time for 5 mints but still the fone would auto lock within seconds.

For a person like me who enjoys clicking a lot of pictures and taking selfies, the camera is of prime importance. But it seems, the company paid no attention to this feature. The camera is unimpressive. The picture quality is extremely poor and most of the pictures are blurred - don't know why that is happening though. I really was not expecting this from such a prestigious company. It is incredibly tough to save contacts. I tried umpteen times but was unable to save them as the contacts would be deleted - AUTOMATICALLY!!!! I really do not know what the problem is. I am also not too impressed with the battery life.

Pros -
1. Super smooth for everyday performance no hiccups anywhere.
2. Enough battery life for light to medium usage.
3. Very versatile camera setup. You have wide+tele+macro
4. Regular updates from Oneplus.
5. Oxygen OS has the right mix of stock android and added features.
6. Speakers and the display is very good.

Cons -
1. OnePlus cheaped out on providing a proper cooling solution. This phone doesn't have a Vapour chamber or a
  Copper heat pipe. Instead it is using the aluminum frame of the device as a heatsink. What this means to you is that
  when you play PUBG/CODM for longer time the phone heats up but from the left side making it very difficult to
  hold the device in hand. If you use a case then you won't feel as much heat but you won't get efficient cooling. I
  don't recommend this phone for Long sessions of Gaming as this phone lacks in proper cooling solution.
2. Battery life is average at best for heavy usage.

Camera quality is decent.
Battery life is also good that it last about a day with average screen on time of about 7 hours.
Thanks to 30W charger which comes with it in the box.
Phone is performing very good. I have used this phone for 800 hrs up time. But found nothing serious.
Dislikes:
Brand: OnePlus is giving awesome phone each time but within 6 months it comes with OnePlus 7T with better performance and features than OnePlus 7 Pro at lower price. They are not maintaining the value of their flagships. I have spent 58k for this phone and now I feels like I have paid for wrong device.
I advice all to go for Samsung or Apple iPhones because they are maintaining value of their flagships for at least a year.

Camera: It will miss some frames when recording in slow motion. Also there are many flaws in camera system which may be resolved with software updates.

At last I will say that Amazon service was very poor. When I ordered this phone from Amazon, It was reached at Amazon's local facility whithin two days. But As I am a non prime member, they took 2 more days for delivery. They were able to deliver the phone within 2 days but they didn't.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews

I had recently  bought one plus 7t, all other features - performance, camera, interface are good but the battery backup is not even average it's pathetic. I had already replaced the device once within couple of days of purchase as amazon technician also confirmed there is some serious battery drain issues. Yesterday I received a new device and it seems the battery life is even worse than the previous one. I feel amazon has just replaced the device with some other battery issue model and have not ensured the new model is as per the specification mentioned by the manufacturer (amazon representative had assured that the new piece will be in good condition - bit this was not ensured by them) .

But one thing which still bothers me is that, it crashed while I was playing Call Of Duty mobile. Like literally I couldn't finish the game at all. Now I'm no expert, but one thing is certainly obvious that OnePlus 7t is a device which should be able to withstand high graphic games in extreme modes. However, I doubt if it could have been a software problem from the game itself unable to run smoothly on my device or was it my phone's problem? I don't know...all things considered #PUBG works Great on my phone even in extreme graphic OnePlus 7t can pull it off without a sweat. But I gotta tell you though your hands are gonna sweat it out.😜
#Fingerprint Scanner.
It's okay and not so fast as those dedicated finger prints sensors I'd say, but sometimes it failed to recognize my own finger prints!! So I'd give it 6 out of 10. And I've got my reasons for rating it that way and it's pretty convenient if I'd explain why, besides it's much easier to understand practically.😅

It's pretty great I love the way OnePlus represents their Camera Performance although it's not up to Max.

A beast no doubt about it.,Reviewed in India on 24 May 2019,"Upgraded from my OnePlus 6 just a few days back after using OnePlus 6 for about 10 months or so.

Initial observation :
1. QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.
2. No notch whatsoever.
3. Near Stock Android experience.
4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung's flagship phones.

Pro's :
1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.
2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc
3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO's VOOC Charge 3).
4. Good ROM options.
5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.
6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.
7. Apps open fast, really fast.
8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It's that fast.

CON's :
1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.
2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).
3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don't compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.
4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during ""conference"" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.
5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.

Will update after a few more days of use.

UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :

Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.
IPhone XS Max also doesn't give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn't even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.

Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.

It's a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT's, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.

Will update after a few more days......

As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.

Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday. We hope you guys could understand and allow us more time keep working on the camera.

Performance is great.

Pros:
1. Beautiful display without notch/punch hole.
2. Easy access to older phone stuff (basically setting up this phone was insanely easy with all the ways offered to sync your data)
3. Fingerprint scanner & face unlock is super quick and secure (couple of my friends actually tried to unlock my phone with my photo.. didn't work lol)
4. Audio quality from both stereo speakers and earphones in amazing.

Cons:
1. No 3.5mm jack or even a convertor pin out of the box (which is huge for me, I'm still stranded as there is no stock for the convertor on the official store).
2. Phone is massive, just about fits in my jeans pocket.
