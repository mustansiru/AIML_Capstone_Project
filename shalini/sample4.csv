Then realized that people have been sent soap and marbles in such packaging in the past that Amazon had to secure it from the middlemen who sneak it through.
The 7T is a powerhouse and yet it saves a lot of power to push you through the day. All in all, the phone is excellent with a lot of tinkering options available for you to play with this handful of tech marble(not marvel). But the irony is not lost on the fact that I have clicked the attached pics with one of the better camera phones (Honor 8 pro) for the review. Will update with the pics clicked by 7T soon.

Pros:
- The network bands this phone supports (of which there are many) allow this phone to be easily used in many parts of the world without the need of finding the right carrier for each country. For example this supports 12/16 bands used in the US for 4G.

Cons:
- Compared to other phones at this price point, the cameras aren't very good.

No worry
 OnePlus was found in the name of the Flagship Killer when you came to Market  Now oneplus's own flagship phone come to the market.
At least in Apple's XR include ear buds in the box for free
You had to take some Option to For the Earphone
While you are charging a Flagship phone price, but you are not giving us the complete accessories.

Package was well packed and phone looks very premium with nebula blue colour. And the given tpu case was very nice and protective too. All box contents are ok but if the type c to 3.5mm connector is they given means it would be nice. Bcas we have to purchase it by additional cost..
Pros:
Display quality qhd display
90hrtz refresh rate was nice
Finger print reader was better sometime lags
Warp charger do's it's work better
Network connectivity and voice clarity also nice
Android 10 after update battery is quite good
Cons
No type c to 3.1 connector
And I can't get normal temper glass for this model bcas it needed uv tempered glass it cost you min 700/-
Camera software could be updated
Bulky in hand bcas of 208gm weight

The phone boosts of great specs, but being an iPhone user since 5 years, I regret I bought this phone. (As I wanted dual sim mobile in budget with good battery which wasn't the case in iPhone 7)
The camera is average, the inbuilt software softens/smoothens all images that u click thereby causing the photos to look less natural.. Video recording is good but not the best.. iPhone 7 was better in terms of photo and video quality even when it was actually launched in 2016.
Battery is also average.. Heavy user like me does feel it's on the lower side.. Thank god they provide a fast charger..
The only thing that I like is the display which is great and storage which starts at 128GB.

Camera - If I compare the true colours of the pictures I take in my iPhone and OnePlus, iPhone is far better in terms of true colours. OnePlus photos are auto enhanced with whitish colours which is not real.

Speed - Better than iPhone X.

Wireless charging - OnePlus 7 doesn't support wireless charging. iPhone does.

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player¬†The good
 The OnePlus 7 Pro is fast, has a neat pop-up camera and its triple rear cameras take fantastic pictures -- all at very less than its closest Samsung and iPhone rivals.
It's screen is made by Samsung but Samsung itself doesn't have that screen
90hz display is a gem in this phone after using this phone you can't use any other 60hz phones
The bad
 OnePlus' new phone is heavy and isn't rated for water resistance. It lacks wireless charging and a headphone jack.

The bottom line
 The OnePlus 7 Pro's camera, performance and price make it the go-to premium Android phone of 2019.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

Camera is very good at the price point, comparable to OnePlus 7 Pro but there is still scope of improvements.
Battery life is good and lasts a full day for medium usage.
The screen is really nice and cool with 90Hz refresh rate and looks brighter than other AMOLED display phones in that price range.
However, there are some important omissions like lack of notification lights, Always On display feature, Low performance from front camera in low light etc.
The pricing seems not reasonable since the competition is much higher now and most of the features are available at lower price range.

To conclude, Impressive effort from OnePlus, Significant upgrade but costs more than the expectation.

P.S. - The main plus of this phone is Oxygen OS and given hardware chipset 855+ SoC which makes the phone blazing fast.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

Cons:
1. These new phones have Type C as headphone jacks but Oneplus didn't even provide with a Type - C Converter. which is a drawback.

I was an iPhone user and was looking for a phone of price range 30-40k.
i was searching from a month to buy a decent phone so after watching number of videos about the phone i decided to buy OnePlus 7t. i used it for 3-4 days and sold it on OLX for the loss of 4000. The experience was very bad.
I thing i want to tell you please don't go by specifications, they are making fool. i will tell my point by point.
Display- They says Fluid amoled display but believe me its very ordinary display. Its goes blind in the sunlight my Iphone 6s display is batter than this in the sun light.
Camera- back camera takes photos in details but colors are not natural. Contrast is very high. one can clearly see the difference between the actual colors and color of the objects in the photos.
Face Detection sensor- is not very good. it doesnt work all the time.
Size- Phone is large in size.

And I can say this is the best phone I have ever used .
The 90hz display is amazing
I can guarantee once you started using the phone on 90hz you can't go back to lower refresh rate.. you will feel and can see the other phones lagging..
Camera is not up to the mark but the latest update improve a lot .. and can be better in next updates..
Battery life is good ... Not the best due to higher refresh rate and quad hd resolution.. but if you want good battery life you can do so by changing the screen resolution to full HD+ and the refresh rate to 60hz..
The fingerprint is super fast..
And the WARP Charge , this is amazing..
The phone charges very quickly..

Above all,you just can't have the best of everything but you can come close to eternity...that's OnePlus 7 Pro for you.
Regarding delivery and packaging,Amazon never ceases to amaze and I candidly have never been so excited on seeing a package such smoothly arranged and sturdy being handed over.Besides, OnePlus has a tie-up with amazon.in and thus the product is genuine.

Coming from OnePlus 3T user, this is a pleasant upgrade.. 8GB Ram-256GM storage
The main USP of this phone is the display, the wrap charger which is ultrafast and the performance..would never hang up on you despite innumerous apps or games..however I did see a couple of apps crashed at times..
The Antutu score is around 3.5L ..which is impressive..
Coming to battery, when phone arrived it was at 48pc and took close to 25mins tomfull.charge with wrap.charge..
With moderate to heavy usage the battery last for entire day..
With the dash charger , takes a little longer but fast enough..
Have hardly observed any heating issues with multiple apps open..

The biggest let down though is the camera..
Immediately after opening the phone from box and configuring it came an OTA update mainly for camera..
Took some shots and have extensively used in last few days and shots are just normal not exceptional including the much advertised macro mode..the nightscape mode though is an exception..
The auto camera settings are over saturated with red's and yellows are too warm to be real when you view them on big screen ..
I hope the OnePlus team updates the camera eventually as.this is purely SW related since the hardware in paper is great and capable of shooting exceptional photos..having said that as of today the camera is equivalent to any phone in 15k-20k range...compared it with M30s and M30s came out to be better in some.occasions under similar lighting...so.if u are truly looking for a great camera don't go for it..Though the front camera was much better and photos came out natural
However if u trust the OnePlus communtiy n developerslike me :) this phone is simply amazing with it's screen , performance and battery ..
The stock.android like experience is an icing on cake with buttery smooth feel without any lag whatsoever..
Good luck!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

Loving it.,Reviewed in India on 4 October 2019,"Unboxing experience is not good because of in-the-box accessories (there are none). Not asking for an earphone but at least a Type C to 3.5mm Jack was expected.

Coming to phone. It is fabulous.

Screen - Personally coming from QHD display to FHD Amoled display, I can't see the difference. 90Hz refresh rate will make you feel other phones lagging.

Build - Build quality is good. Gorilla Glass at screen is good enough to handle little drops. Back glass can be fragile. Use this phone with a case and take it out of it sometime to praise it's look.

Performance - No words.

Camera - A lot of playful modes that you can try, shooting macro shots is great, video stabilization is good, 960 fps slow motion is also coming to this phone. Photos turns out great, but Colors are not natural. Hope they can fix it with updates.

Speakers - Loud and clear.

Network Connectivity - Cellular reception is very good, WiFi strength is also good. I am able to use WiFi where my previous phone struggled.

Haptic feedback - OnePlus claims they have improved haptic feedback on this phone. They might have done it, but there are better phones out there with better vibration. From my experience, vibrations on this phone is thin but instant.

Charging - Warp 30T is very fast. Charges to 100% in about an hour. Some people here are confused regarding the charging brick because they were expecting WARP 30T branding on the included charger. The internal circuitry inside this phone makes charging even faster, the ""T"" is inside your phone not on the brick, that's why included charger is WARP 30 and not WARP 30T.

Oxygen OS - Smooth. No lag, no heating, quick updates, inbuilt app lock and call recorder. The best android fork which is close to stock and have necessary functionalities built in.

Verdict : If you are planning to buy a practical phone within 40k budget, get this one, you won't regret.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Battery life can be a slight issue for very very heavy user .. upon full charge I can play 3 hrs of PUBG and 2 hrs of yt and WhatsApp it can last for the day .. ending at around 10-15 percent but then again if u can charge it just once for half an hour it will give u an amazing battery performance.Thanks for warp charge.
Only thing is 3,5mm jack it's not there u need to get official dongle from the store for it to work because the audio output except the official one is trash 3 Rd party vendor dongles won't give u nice audio ..

I really liked the phone, the ONLY phone with the snapdragon 855 processor. I was excited with it for the speed but then I gradually realized that the battery life is shorter than compared to any other phone in the same range. Also the camera's provided by the other companies are three (wide angle) on the rear but in one plus 7 no wide angle in this price range.
One more disadvantage is newer phones are bezel less but one plus 7 isn't. The phone don't even have 3.5 mm jack. Even the box does not come with 3.5 mm jack to type C adapter which makes it more difficult for the user with existing earphones/headphones (if does not support Bluetooth).

Pros:
There are surely few advantages like screen clarity, camera resolution and definitely speed. You can play any heavy games available on the play store. The camera has quite different modes that can help you with stunning photos.
The android 9 itself is quite stable and has lots more features, like one plus 7 can use most of it to make UI better.
The sound clarity with these price range is awesome, I cannot expect more from a phone. True sound with Dolby Atmos, just want to hear more music.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-608/product-reviews/B07HGBMJT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

Read the exceptions!!,Reviewed in India on 25 October 2019,"Hi Folks, this is no doubt a good phone. Its snappy fast and swift at handling everyday activities.
There are 2 issues though.
1. Camera blur control! That is simply not available! Oxygen OS should include that. Gcam helps but, thats about it.
2.sound clarity over Bluetooth! Don't get me wrong!
Its loud! Its really really good and music is ok. However, bass that deep bass is not good and vocals are not clear. On Spotify, you may get a better experience but on gana its poor.
There is something to do with Dolby that you cannot switch off! I am using ath sr30 bt from audio Technica and Mi phones have better sound over Bluetooth!

So those are the cons! The fact that it shattered on the bend test is also something one needs to take into account! The massive cutout for the camera us a design flaw Making the glass weak which breaks it!

If you can handle it and no blur control is no problem, like the kind of sound it produces...then go for it!

Wait for 7 instead,Reviewed in India on 21 May 2019,"My 3rd OnePlus and had a bit of additional hope from this model. Though not completely disappointed below are few observations after using this phone for few days.

1. Too heavy for a phone compared with the other similar or near similar models.

2. For some reason I don't see the battery is a winner.

3. I do not play games. But apps like Amazon, Flipkart and few others have few seconds lag while opening it. So not sure if it is my phone or all have this issue.

4. Camera is OK compared to other similar models available

5. Instances of heating while browsing for a bit long. Clueless why

5. Wrap charger and Dash Charger. Don't see any major difference. May be some technically, but as an user I personally don't see any huge difference.

Decent camera modules on front and back, traits great pictures in daylight, more than enough for social media uploads.

My cousins have been using OnePlus phones (OnePlus 3 and 5T) since a long time. I was previously using the Redmi Note 4 so the jump to OnePlus was quite a big one for me. From using an entry level phone to buying a Flagship, it was a giant leap. Got great discount on this phone (‚Çπ3600 off for exchanging Redmi Note 4 and ‚Çπ1700 off on ICICI card). I got the phone on 16th of October and have been using the phone ever since. I'll divide my review between the pros and cons
PROS:-
1. BATTERY LIFE. It may seem weird but somehow because of OnePlus's optimizations, I'm getting a SOT of around 6.5-7 hours. If you really try to kill the battery, then also you'd get a SOT of atleast 5 hours
2. PERFORMANCE. This phone absolutely flies. The SD855+ processor is a multitasking beast. No stuttering or lags whatsoever
3. RAM MANAGEMENT. The RAM management on this phone is insanely good. Apps never get refreshed. Just don't enable the RAM Boost option in settings
4. CAMERA. The cameras on this phone are great. Daytime photos look good with slightly increased contrast. The nightscape mode is just too good. Better than Pixels in my opinion. The Super Stable Video mode is a godsend
5. SOUND QUALITY. The stereo speakers on this phone are extremely loud and clear. Dolby Atmos really works
6. HAPTICS. The vibration motor on this phone is really awesome. Crisp and Precise
7. CHARGING. This phone charges at a crazy fast rate. I get 0-71% in half an hour and 0-100% in 55 minutes
8. DISPLAY. That 90hz refresh rate is silky smooth. You won't go back to 60hz again. Every other phone with 60hz refresh rate (iPhone, Note 10+, Pixel 3 XL, Mate 30 Pro etc) feels laggy after using this phone.

CONS:-
1. SYSTEM STABILITY. There are a few bugs here. The brightness wouldn't go to full even after you have set it to max. It'll take 1-2 seconds extra to go to full brightness. Sometimes, Chrome freezes on its own.
2. NO USB-C TO 3.5MM DONGLE IN BOX
3. NO EARPHONES IN BOX

MISCELLANEOUS:-
1. The screen flickers at low brightness. Not a hardware issue. It's the nature of OLED displays. You can't see it with your naked eyes but a camera can pick it up. If it bothers you, enable the DC Dimming feature
2. AMOLED displays have a hard time displaying correct images on a dark grey background under low brightness. So no need to panic if you see some reddish or greenish tint on a grey background

Overall, This is an awesome phone. No phone is perfect. Each phone has a few bugs. I have already got 2 software updates regarding system stability and camera quality. OnePlus is known to remove all bugs from their phones through software updates so no need to worry if you find some bugs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

I have been a One Plus user since last 4 years now. Started from the One Plus 5. Then the One Plus 6T and now the One Plus 7T. It's not the affiliation to the brand but the value for money that the brand offers. I also have the iPhone 7. But the display and smoothness that One Plus offers is unparalleled.
Pros
1 Superior display 90hz
2 super fast fingerprint reader
3 fnatic gaming mode
4 excellent battery life (90hz gives 4-5 hours and 60 hz gives an hour more )
5 camera improved to the best. ( The 7t pro launched a few days back still lags behind the 7T)
6 super macro mode is amazing.
7 android 10 out of the box on top of oxygen os 10 is delightful.

Cons
Hard to find any. Some minor glitches which may improve after the promised updates.
Battery optimization and some apps tend to crash unexpectedly due to non optimization. But after the update,the problem may be solved. Other than that amazing phone.

But Okey,Reviewed in India on 2 October 2019,"I bought it becoz they saying that it has fluid amoled display,display is good but not like 7pro.
Performance is good as like as one plus 7 or more
i used it for 1day now , i felt there is a camera setup diffrence in 7 and 7t.performance is same upgradation for sure.

Though All One plus sets are Fast i bought it for fluidic display like 7pro otherwise i would have bought 7pro.this is the only thing disappoint me.
one plus could have made this more premium in 40k in looks , means phone built or making it full screen phone but no notches.

friends saying that it looks likes moto phone from backüòèüò£. not looks premium but everything is good performance.

1.sound is crystal clear
2.unique camera setup
3.ultra fast screen.
4. no lag
5. Camera is perfect
6.display is good but not fully fluidic like. 7pro

performance is 10/10 as of now.
camera is 9/10
Pubg is 10/10
charging is 10/10
premiumness 7/10

Phone gets hot if I play games like pubg in QHD+ and 90hz display mode with fnatic mode one(it is a built in feature to improve gaming experience and it does improve noticeably my 8n game frame rate reduced 10ms) and gets really hot if I play two more games and it burns through battery. The battery life otherwise is pretty good easily lasts a ""day"" (more than 7 hours) with normal to heavy usage (I use it with screen turned on for 6 hours with half brightness 90hz and FHD+ display with volte data ebabled, in that 6 hours 3 hours of continuous online gaming 2 and half hours of watching online videos while traveling and the remaining 1 hour just aimlessly scrolling the refresh rate is something else). Camera quality is something else especially the video I prefer to take snapshots from video if I should be taking videos like in a concert or something but the low light camera performance is a little disappointing because it doesn't have motion capture and the evening images look shaky because of it and also the lens is affected by stray lights leaving a lens flare often which would be cool with sunlight but street light and reflection of tubelight from a puddle of water can be really annoying. I would've really liked if we could choose various lenses for video but it seems to capture video from the main lens onle. Charging is amazing, it is exactly as advertised so do check the promotion video. No screen protector from oneplus although thier cases are good. I would recommend u buying a 3.5 mm jack adapter because no bluetooth headphones are worth it if you play a lot of games like me ( bluetooth latency is a beach) not even aptx low latency headphones can compete with your gaming if you turn on fnatic mode. Audio quality and clarity is great but output volume is a little low in bluetooth speaker and headphones in phone speakers are almost good as a TV but much crisp and clearer. Final points I'm using this phone for the last 2 months it is a lot of fun and useful but a pain to hold it for more than 20 mins because of the thickness, design and weight phone is really slippery despite the weight and looks I would recommend a good case from oneplus itself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

Amazon delivered the phone in a days so Kudos for that. I upgraded from OP5T due to the bargain price on offer but have mixed feelings for phone. Over all its a good phone. Here goes my thoughts on it at length üòÄ.
It feels bigger, taller and heavier in hand compared to 5T. Sincerely wish someone starts making flagship phone in smaller form factor again.
Have screen guard and a rugged case in the box which is a plus.
3.5 mm doesn't come with it so have to order one. I'm not a fan of bluetooth headset as it's one more thing that I have to remind myself to charge.
OP launcher is feature rich so I haven't gone back to my Nova prime yet.
Tried to backup and restore with OP switch with mixed results.. didn't restore my apps 1st time but asked to restore again while I was midway through reinstalling my apps.
Camera is good but will take getting used to. Does not allow choosing the megapixel size explicitly any longer.
Overall it has been a step up in terms of specs but have mixed feelings comparing it to my OP5t",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros:-
1. It is buttery smooth and fast. Thanks to Oxygen.
2. The network reception is fantastic. It does not fluctuate much during journeys.
3. The Display is fantastic and no complaints.
4  I am not a gaming buff so no comments about gaming.
5. Charging is very fast which compensates the smaller battery capacity.

Cons
 1.I felt that One Plus should have provided a good quality cover and not the plastic one that is now provided.
2.The camera could have been better and one plus has to go a long way to catch up Samsung and Iphone in this regard.
3.Battery performs on an average note and one plus should look into it in future.

Otherwise it is a fantastic phone! It is smooth to the word! Just loving it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

Super fast charger. Battery percentage reached 77% from 15% only in 26 mins. Thanks to Warp charging.

The phone is super fast. I noticed a lot of difference from my previous phone (RN5 Pro) when it comes to paying using Paytm.

The photos are coming really good.  Especially the photos that are shot in low light. The camera app itself suggests - based on the environment -when we should use the Wide landscape option.

The only con is the unavailability of head phone jack. I wish OnePlus had provided the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the phone's package. Otherwise it costs ‚Çπ390 in Oneplus stores.

So I do suggest considering this.

But this OnePlus is horrible.
Adaptive screen brightness is the basic thing and OnePlus fails here.
I do not have a count on number of times this phone freezed
There was an emergency situation when this phone was hanged.

Main pointers -
Avg UX, UI.

Buttery smooth exp to work across all multitasking & data / memory usage done (optimising improvement is begged).

Major disappointments in occasional PHONE HANGS. Inappropriate & sudden change/disappearance of Software buttons.

Sudden Magnifications

Bugged issues without ever using any shady apps or functions / data / updates

Poorly Informed USER community of O+ & service troubleshooting.

The phone didn't quiet throw us off the hook & wow us. Though it was a decent phone the PRICING is definitely pickled out for a 7pro 256Gb device.

The TOUCH is somewhat shaky, the kind of conviction one should feel shouldn't come through. The edges sometimes don't register well or register incorrectly according to application. Fr ex while typing this text at times the characters at the edges of the screen didn't register well while clicking perfectly on to it.

USER INTERFACE & USER EXP - is probably so-so. Some diehard fans may not agree but my sister can emulate how it's not really matching upto standards expected of a flagship phones after using brands like Samsung or Apple. From the beginning one has felt that OP7PRO may not give us full convictions while using it, it has to work convincingly well. The issues may lie in incoherent ways of APP /SOFTWARE /HARDWARE design. Maybe the efficiency still needs to be Upped.

SERVICE ISSUES seem to be plaguing from beginning, as mentioned earlier. However can't be called as issue as such. But later 60-90 days after purchase from AMAZON, the bloody thing started acting crazy. Sisters data was at risk and also official stuff couldn't be foregone. Servicing within 90days of purchase has really made it unpleasant n unconvincing. As a professional my sister wouldn't use anything shady from 3parties. Yet seems like suddenly bugs appear from nowhere, or some issues which are not directly claimed responsibility by OP+service teams and leadership teams of services.

Servicing was done obviously but we didn't like that a phone goes berserk so soon. Service Manager at Brigade Bangalore, sorted issues after a marathon call of 6hours with call center who couldn't fix issue on call. Service engineer obviously fixed the issue with something called a QTIP PIE reset Something, IAM not sure of (press power+volume button simultaneously for 30+seconds). It might have fixed issues temporarily only though.

REMORSE RATING??
One does feel a little off-put buying this device & hasn't really satisfied. Some issues while usage one can feel it's incompetencies... Though one cannot prove it. Basically User experience is not at par with flagship highest standards achieved by Smartphone industry.

At the end of the Day it has made us feel to switch to another BRAND or look for upgrade to 7T but still with scepticism.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_156?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=156&reviewerType=all_reviews

It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.
As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.
All in all, it's an okay phone for the money, but if you're concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you're better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.
If having high quality photo or video doesn't rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.
If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It's definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros:
1. I am a great fan of One Plus and i have been using one plus5 from last 2 year so there is no question of phone getting lagging issue or anything like that, but when i received my One Plus 7Pro lagging word is simply unavailable in my dictionary.
2. About fingerprint scanner it is quiet good but just hopping to be little faster, (Personal opinion) may be it is because of on display scanner some micro seconds delayed would be there.
3. Popup camera is best in class, face recognition is simply awesome.
4. Battery backup is ok you get whole-day utilization time if you are a frequent user.
5. Last thing the built quality & design is simply awesome. One has to be only careful for accidentally dropping on backside & on display corners because of it curve display.

Cons:-
1. No headphone jack 3.5mm one has to buy c-type converter or c-type headphone.
2. Its very difficult to put tempered glass for curve screen mobiles i have tried twice perfect fitting is impossible.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews

This phone is one of the best Android phones in the market right now.

Pros
1) Display is the best aspect of this phone
2) Performance is pretty good
3) Fingerprint reader is very quick
4) Dolby stereo speakers is really good
5) One thing I noticed while playing Asphalt game for over an hour is that phone didn't get heated up too much
6) Battery backup isn't bad. Warp charge helps in quick charging of the phone for extreme usage
7) Response time of front camera is pretty good

Cons
1) Phone is a bit bigger
2) No 3.0 mm audio jack which could have been compensated with bullets wireless earphones given the phone's cost
3) Camera hardware might be really good but camera app certainly needs improvement. This is my opinion after comparing images taken with S10, S10+ and also given that OnePlus ran ads claiming OP 7 pro being used in multiple photoshoots

This phone is really worth the cost except for the camera app which I think will be improved with the upcoming updates.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews

Let's divide it in pros and cons.

Pros-
1- One of the best feature of this phone is it's Display.  It's Quad HD display is one of the best in the market and at par with the likes of S10, iPhone series.

2- The curved display gives a brilliant overall premium look and practicality to this phone. The curve is so subtle that it kind of flows in the phone and gives you a better grip.

3-  90hz refresh rate is like you slipping I'm butter. It's is so smooth that you will feel odd using other mobiles. You can feel the difference as soon as you pick this phone.

4- After the camera update all bugs are gone now and the picture quality you are getting at this price is brilliant and on par with likes of Samsung and iPhone. You just have to change the camera settings to get the best out of it. There are 1000 plus videos to guide you through it.

5- Stereo Speaker, A person who has used One plus before will understand what a drastic improvement one plus has done on sound quality. It's is loud, it's is crisp and any audiophile will like it.

6- Call quality. Cellular call quality and reception is good with this phone. There is no lag or anything with this device.

7- Built quality- The phone is premium looking, well built beast. No flaws or air gaps you can find and it gives you an confidence when you hold it in your hands.

Cons-

1-  First I have to right this. There are so many reviews for this phone giving 1 star and stating that they have seen on YouTube that it comes with a headphone and they didn't receive it. I mean this  is heights of stupidity guys. Firstly, in description only it is clearly mentioned what all comes with the phone and secondly youtubers get a review unit which is totally different from a retail unit. One cannot judge a phone on this particular thing.

2- Battery- So you have a big battery here and with a moderate to heavy media use it will last you to 12-14 hours.

This includes 2-3 hours calling
Social media consumption
Streaming sites consumption ( as World Cup in going on and we want India to win)

So, battery will give you above average use but it is definitely not bad. Morey, one can change the 90hz refresh rate setting to 60hz and Qhd to Hd setting if you want more battery life, but again what's the fun here.

3- 3.5 mm headphone jack- So I was one of guys who was really disappointed with this move of removing 3.5 mm jack. But, after getting this phone I got good Bluetooth headphone and I understood that what I was missing. Sound quality wise the opinion is divided among people as some say you get better sound quality over Bluetooth and some say it is better with 3.5 mm headphone jack. But, the kind of freedom you get with wireless device is way way better. And after you get a wireless earbuds or headphone you will understand that it is way better than wired ones. So, personally this is not a con for me now.

4- weight- Phone is definitely heavy when you compare to other phones. But, you will get use to it. And after some time you will feel more confident with the weight of this phone while handling. It is not an issue.

Conclusion- So one plus was a brand which use to kill the flagships of the year and now it has created a flagship of its own. We should understand this that usually a flagship phone which we get from Samsung or Apple at 70-80k, here we are getting it for 50k. This phone gives you all the premium features at a lesser price than its competitors.

So, if you have a budget of around 50k. You should go for this phone without even thinking twice definitely it's flagship of the year with the price point it comes. Just go for it guys!!!!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews

However, the camera or its software leaves much to be desired.

Pros:
1.Display (though brightness could have been better) - My friends are just awestrucked by the quality of display OnePlus has put in. They say ""ufff!! Display ta dekh just, chokchok kor6e"" (Look at the display, it's shining), ""Side theke dekh, sera, sera, kato daam re phone tar, amio kinbo"" (look at from the sides, awesome, awesome, how much does this phone cost,I will also buy it).

2.Battery life - 1 day battery backup for heavy users. If used in dark mode and 30-40% brightness in auto switch & 90hz mode you may get upto 1.5 days battery life. But even if the battery get drained warp charge will charge it in an hour.

3. Vibration - Best among most of the android phones out there but only bettered by iphone.

4. Performance - Best performer till date. Oneplus's software is the benchmark for the mobile industry. Take a bow oneplus.

5. Sound Quality -  Loud & Crisp. Though a little more depth would have been appreciated.

CONS

1. Camera - Camera is a mixed bag. It takes inconsistent photos. But yesterday I received 9.5.10 update which corrected the over warm tone of the photos. People don't look too pinkish & focusing is also improved. Wide angle lens can't be used in videos as of now but oneplus is working on an update & will introduce this feature surely. Selfies are ok. In comparison to pixel & iphone & samsung's flagship phones this camera may be inferior,but I have to say oneplus is able to improve the camera performance of this mobile through multiple updates. Now I am satisfied with the camera performance of this beast. Camera isn't a deal breaker anymore.

2. Lack of headphone jack - Even the type c to 3.5mm headphone is not included within the box & after 2 months of this phone's launch oneplus is still not able to make it available to purchase from online or offline stores. Shame on you oneplus. You couldn't give an adapter worth ‚Çπ390 (manufacturing cost is ‚Çπ40) in the box of a ‚Çπ50k rupees phone. This is my biggest gripe using this phone. But it's a fault of OnePlus not the phone.

Edit : Today I bought oneplus's official audio adapter from their website for ‚Çπ439 (including shipping fee).

3. No IP rating & wireless charging - though I don't need them.

4. Customer Support - No where near the quality of this phone. Few service centres are available. Most of the accessories are out of stock. I am very disappointed with the service of oneplus.

5. Tempered glass - No official tempered glass launched by oneplus for op 7 pro whereas it's available for the regular 7. I purchased an uv glue glass from a local shop worth ‚Çπ600 & the glues are spreading from the sides of the phone. Oneplus should have released their official tempered glass for their best phone.

6. Price - I read from the internet that the manufacturing cost of this phone is ‚Çπ22k. But you are charging more than  double the manufacturing cost. This phone should have been priced at ‚Çπ40k,though it's cheaper than samsung and apple's flagships.

Conclusion
Most of the cons I mentioned are related to the support of oneplus not of this phone. Hence,I would suggest everyone who is looking to buy a real flagship, take this one & you won't regret.

Pros -
Camera in daylight is amazing. Supermacro shots are wonderful and crisp. Inbuilt AI works smooth and detects the scenes in quite good manner.
Telephoto, wide angle and portrait altogether compiles very good camera setup.
Front Camera is similar to what we have in one plus 7.

Processing is smooth like butter, no lags whatsoever. Have got about 90 apps apart from the bloated one's. Opened , worked ,performs very well.

Gaming is brilliant,also the new haptic feedback adds cheery on the cake for gaming.

Sound quality is superb ,both the speakers are tuned and doesnt make any noise or irritation kinda even when it is full. 360' sound effect feels amazing.

Display is very very crisp,clear and Bright. Everything is perfect. Even though its not above 1080p , but never fails.

Battery - Complete 1 day backup for 100% charge. And if 1 or 2 hours goes less, WARP charging is always there.

Cons -
No headphone Jack.

The nightscape is waste it seems. Sometimes its giving patches on the subject making it feel like its painted or something. Not good at all. Hope One plus provides updates on regular intervals for improving this.

Fingerprint reader is not much fast compared to the other devices, however face unlock works perfectly fine. Expecting fingerprint reader will improve in future updates.

Bundling everything in one word - ""Beast"" altogether.

Go for it. Peace.

The look is splendid.  Silver Matt back finish with mirror finish on the curves gives the classy looks it deserves. Have been using it since the last 4 days and here is a quick analysis:
1. Processor is really fast. You can easily notice it as you flip between the apps
2. Face recognition is super quick. At times before u even manage to put ya thumb for finger scanning the phone gets unlocked. Face recognition even in low lights is pretty impressive.
3. The camera precision is brilliant. One can take stunning pics and with portrait mode on the selfie too makes it even better. Have not tested long distance and night pics so cannot comment on that as of now.
4. Game mode is really cool if you are a gaming person which I am.
5. The display is really bright and vibrant. You can easily feel the difference from the earlier phone that you were using
6. Battery life is really excellent. I spend a lot of time on calls during office hrs and game while free time. But the battery really fights out time easily. Also the quick charge is super awesome. It barely takes like an hour for 100% battery. Just plug in for 15 mins and you can easily charge the battery good 40%.
7. The phone comes with a soft transparent case so you need not bother with the drops.
8. Loads of inbuilt features that will only add to the delight once you start exploring them.

Bad point
Just that the charging cable is round instead of the flat cable which is not that simple to twirl and lock. Flat cable was a lot simpler. Also the cable length is standard1 mtr. I would have preferred if they gave 3 mts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews

OnePlus always fascinated me since it's launch however I always gave preference to brand value and user reviews so I neglected it for quiet few time ,but with the advent of 90 Hz refresh rate on phone amoled I seriously couldn't resist myself to buy the phone on the very first week of it's launch..

This is my review after using it for 1 month

Pros

Screen size and crispy display
Warp 30T charge (I think that's the best part)
Super snappy, every thing is so smooth and fast as described in the caption
Built quality/design pretty practical and upto the mark for a flagship

Cons
Battery life , even with moderate usage u have to plug it in 1 day or the very next day early morning
Autoadaptive display is a pain,it never adjust itself as per the ambient light
Big size not suited for small hands, definitely not for ladies
Camera are just like elephant tooth- good for nothing,my last phone was with single camera(S7 edge) and it can beat these 3 cameras in any light conditions
Gestures also function poorly

So to conclude, I am not really happy with the phone and it can't be compared with flagship, OnePlus has their own niche of cheap flagships but in my opinion now they are directed towards money making rather than listening to the consumers

I would suggest people to buy Xiaomi flagship instead

Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.

The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.

I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn't really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won't mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.

The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.

One thing which I want to bring in notice is the ""NIGHTSCAPE"" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.

One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.

Overall I will give it ""4 stars out of 5"". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews

I am using the Mirror Grey version.
I was waiting to complete at least 2 months before I post a review here.

It is worth the money. So many people told me that the phone is looking great and asked me which brand it is.
You will never go back to 60Hz refresh rate phones once you start using this 90Hz version.
I admit that the phone is a bit heavier than the one which I was using before (Xperia Z5 premium), however, it doesn't matter.
4 K videos are just awesome, the camera quality is very nice.
The Dolby Atmos feature and the dual speaker combo is my favorite.

All these are the Pros of PRO.
Now, I have the habit of finding the wrong things when I find something too good :D

-  No headphones jack, they don't provide the C-type headphones connector
-  One plus wireless bullet earphones are always out of stock

I have attached some camera samples which i clicked using nightscape mode, normal, and macro mode.

I was confused between Oneplus 7t and Asus Rog Phone II, but Rog wasn't available so i chose this and really satisfied by it's performance. First of all I'm not hardcore gamer i usually play for hour or two. This phone provides great graphics without getting any heating issue at all. This phone has great battery life as well. I charge it once in a day and it gives me full day battery easily. I use it in 60 hertz and dark mode as it soothes my eyes.

It gives you great in-hand feel. It is not so heavy.

The thing which i didnt like that is it doesn't have 3.5 mm jack and the screen is long but it fits in my pocket very easily.

I wanted frosted silver but wasn't available so, i bought glacier blue which is really good with it's cover",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews

I've been an avid user of Samsung from the last 5 years and I've had all of their flagships. This was my first time with One Plus and I am surprised that it surprises me in all departments.. That flamboyant display with a cheeky 90hz is something ppl say is not noticable...Trsut me the absolute feel of that is beautiful.

Gaming is undeniably the best from the best in this segment.

Camera is great with the patches all of its issues are fixed and going forward many more patch updates will hopefully just make it better.. Stabilization is on point. The audio captured on the videos is great quality.

Speed is absolutely is blazing fast... Yes it is going to face a challenge from the likes of redmi k20 pro. But it is a one plus end of the day and am 100% sure display is where k20 pro is not going to win. Also software optimization and camera is better any day on the op7 pro...

Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.

Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.

The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.

PROS:
CAMERA - 4.8/5
BATTERY- 5/5
Display - 4.7/5
Performance - 4.8/5
Speed - 5/5
Gaming experience- 4.8/5

CONS
NO Headset jack.
One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.
Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)

This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.
CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus.

Buttery smooth touch. Samsung's display looks better cz of the color vividness and saturation. But this one is one of the best display. Processor? 855 sd no need to say more about it. Sound is supergood but still searching for earphones suitable with this device. Just disappointed with the camera. Wide angle is just useless as it has lower angle of view and when you zoom into clicked image its blurry. Same with normal pic. It looks good until you zoom. Pics clicked are not sharp they r soft and blurry. Even redmi phone 15k priced clicks sharper pics than this. 4k 60fps video is certainly something it saves this phone as clarity is really superb.

Get It!",Reviewed in India on 28 October 2019,"I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S8 for the last 2 years and switched to the OnePlus 7t 256 GB a couple of weeks ago. My feedback based on the 2 weeks of rigorous use vis-√†-vis the Galaxy S8 ‚Äì
Pros:
- Amazing 30w Warp Charge is the fastest I have seen. My rigorous use means I need a big battery and being a Samsung loyalist had considered the M30s. However, the sub par specs other than that massive battery on the M30s meant I went for the 7t and I am happy that I chose this.
- The finger print sensor is much better than the Samsung S8 and the haptics are also quite good. Overall the cell phone also feels faster than the S8 in day to day usage and the data access is also visibly faster.
- One grouse I always had with the S8 was that the speaker loudness whether on a phone call or listening to the single speaker was terrible for a flagship phone. By comparison the stereo speakers of the 7t are brilliant. I actually have to turn down the speakers listening to YouTube videos it is that loud.
- The box comes with the fantastic warp charger and surprise, surprise a basic transparent case. I purchased a more robust case as I am prone to dropping my phones but it is a nice gesture by OnePlus. The idiots should probably have included a USB C to 3.5mm jack as well but then there‚Äôs no end to asking for freebies.
Cons:
- The biggest negative is the screen quality. I don‚Äôt mind the 1080p resolution as I also ran my S8 in 1080p to save battery. The problem is that the 7t screen never feels vibrant like the S8 despite adjustments. The back lighting is inconsistent and feels patchy. And for some reason, the Auto backlight adjustment seems to always set up the screen darker than it should. In summary, nothing comes close to a Samsung AMOLED.
- Another aspect of the screen that bugs me is that the oleo phobic coating on the screen or rather the pre applied screen guard is terrible. The screen always looks dirty as compared the superb black mirror look of my Samsung S8.
- The reason I almost didn‚Äôt purchase the 7t was that it offers no SD Card support. I did opt for the larger 256 GB variant but I would still prefer the choice of putting in my own micros SD. I also don‚Äôt like the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack but that doesn‚Äôt affect me much.  I have shifted to the Jabra 65t Elite BT headphones for everyday work. I use a Dragonfly Red DAC with OneMore Quad Drivers for music listening on flights.
- Using the phone over a 40 minutes drive with Android Auto I found the phone heating up. Samsung S8 never had this issue because Samsung is extra cautious about heat management after the exploding Notes episode.
So far so good with the OnePlus 7t. It is superb value as compared to the Samsung S10 range. The S10e that has specs at par with the S8 of nearly 3 years ago is a rip off at 50k+ and the other S10 phones are daylight robbery of even greater magnitudes.
Simply put, I take my phone selection very seriously and frankly there seems to be no phone that can offer better value and user experience at this price range.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page‚Üí,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews

In love with the phone!
THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY. GOT IT DELIVERED AT 6:30 AM NEXT DAY!!!
Yes it is little bulky and huge but i dont think any phone having more than 6 inch screen can be used by single hand.
I have comparitively large hands and still 5.5 inch screen handling was difficult.
Charging and phone Speed is Blazing fast. And display is beautiful and buttery smooth. Dont think any phone has this smooth touch!
It lived to all my expectations and was worth the wait.
My friend used my phone for a while and bought one for himself too!
Highly recommend the phone to people looking for flagship phone.

I tried to use gesture and there was a huge response lag also the camera does not show good colors.
While playing COD mobile the device worked flawless and the battery life is amazing. I guess I received a defective product.

Update: 3 months into using this phone and I have never had a worse android experience in my whole life the only good thing about this phone is the dash charging and battery back up.
Double tap to wake up is a hit or miss.
Camera face retouching is so terrible I literally take a screenshot of the frame to get a natural picture.
