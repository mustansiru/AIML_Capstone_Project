Not actually worth it. The only good thing is oxygen OS,Reviewed in India on 8 January 2020,"This is based on my personal experience having used all types and brands of mobiles. I know it gives good ram and memory. But Samsung's phones with exynos chip that cost the same or lesser, give somewhat same performance despite less ram. This phone sometimes lags. And everything actually is a compromise from gallery system to music, alarm clock, ease of use.
No single hand mode, no proper controls for videos, multi window not that good, sometimes alarm doesnt ring, typing is a bit difficult. The only advantage might be that it will not get slow for years coz of ram n chipset. Moreover there is least support for OP 7. If u search for anything related to it, it will mostly show things for OP 7t/pro",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-608/product-reviews/B07HGBMJT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

I am telling you all the things that I came across.
Firstly I bought it at the price of 39999 rs.
But I exchanged my old phone for which I got 4950 rs exchange .
Thanks to OnePlus's 3000 extra cash back offer.
I paid through sbi credit card and I received 2500 cash back instead of 2000.im surprised when I saw it.
Firstly im talking about display.
Display is so smooth and fluidy. 90 Hz refresh rate works amazing.I mostly life qhd instead fhz.
Battery life is very good after update.
Warp charger works very well.charges very quicky.
Camera performance also great.
Little bit improvement needed in front cam.
Sliding mechanism also runs smoothly. detect fall very quickly.
No lag issue found while playing heavy games.
Little bit heating issue.but no worry about it.
Curve glass looks premium.no disadvantages found.
Oxygen os gives u such amazing experience that other os doesn't .
So finally.
My honest review.which I felt.

1. Resolution and Screen Quality is top notch.
2. Fingerrprint Reader is awesome and extremely responsive and fast
3. Camera Quality is one of the bestin the One Plus line up. Macro mode is an icing on the cake,
4. 90Hz Display is not a feature but an experience which you will only feel once you use the app drawer  and the OS
5. Oxygen OS -android 10 -out of the box with regular updates .
6. No lags , No stutters.
7. Awesome RAM management and fluid app switches.
8. Ergonomics of the phone has been improved as compared to 7
9. OK Battery backup. Nothing great but charging is super fast
10. WARP CHARGE 30T technology which juices up the phone is less than an hour.
11. Loud stereo sound and perfect for audiophiles
12.Type C usb and 256 gb internal storage.
13. The back panel is smoother than a baby's bum.

CONS_

1. Hideous camera design. This is subjective though. They could have kept a horizontal or vertical module. But i got no complaints since i got used to it and the camera quality is quite a stunner. Please dont expect IPHONE results - each brand has its own strengths and weaknesses.

2. This phone is perfect for gaming as well but then you would have to put it on charge because the battery backup isnt like the ROG series. But i aint a gamer so i dont care.

3. No headphone jack. Type C usb , so only one charging port to be shared with type c earphones. Additonal kharcha if u dont own one.

4.FHD+ AND NOT QHD PANEL - WHY ONE PLUS WHY?

5. Gorilla Glass 5 and not 6 - this is sheer cost cutting.

All in all - if i dont nitpick , i am very satisfied with this device. Its a beast and a perfect phone for mid to heav usage. This phone has removed all the flaws of its predecessors ,esp the large notch of the one plus 7 and stupid depth sensor and one additonal camera.

GO FOR IT BLINDLY.

So my comparision will primarily be with these two.
Performance: One word - snappy !
Display: Gorgeous. 90hz refresh rate is clearly noticeable.
Battery: Now this is the most criticised aspect of the phone , well let me tell u it is NOT Bad at all ! Believe it or not I got 5+ hrs screen on time with 38% remaining , yes u read that right ! Can't believe it ?! Lol i have screenshot of the battery usage , see it for yourself. So technically I could have easily churned out 8hrs or more screen on time if i had used it till 5% battery. What is confusing is almost every reviewer on YouTube or even user reviews have quoted a maximum of 5.5 hrs SOT at max. Now let me share some tips which i feel might helped in my case , when i first setup my phone i was to migrate my data n apps from old phone. But i did not copy the nearly 100apps i had in my nokia 7 plus , instead i just copied the contacts and messages n synced other settings with Google account. I then clean installed all the apps that i use on a regular basis i.e some 20 odd apps. I am not sure but i feel this could have helped in improving the battery life. I always keep my location off n 4g data always on + wifi when available.
Camera: Now most people compare this phone n it's camera with Apple , Google , samsung flagships but fail to understand that those phones cost almost double that of this phone ! The camera takes brilliant pics in good light , low light any lighting condition u throw at it. This camera is a lot good when viewed in isolation n it is only a lil bit inferior when compared side by side with iphone 11 or pixel 3/4 , also u get wide angle camera which is missing on pixel. The camera is more than good enough for social media uploads.

Conclusion: Best phone overall n VFM by a mile. If u game a lot then get ROG 2 because that has a bigger battery but as an everyday driver for normal usage this is best !",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros :
Fastest phone in the market. Trust me after using this phone, you will not feel like using anything else
Fingerprint scanner is the fastest in the market & it is amazing
Phone charging is blazing fast
Camera is too good & the nightscape is amazing. At par compared to Samsung and much better than Redmi phones
Oxygen OS is like stock android with Zero ads and no preinstalled garbage apps
You can watch HDR and 4K contents in this phone and the screen quality is out of the world. Watching HDR in Netflix is a bliss in this phone
Video recording in 4k 60fps is amazing

Cons
Camera can be little better particularly video can't be recorded in wide angle lens
Battery life is average considering the consumption if you turn on QHD display with 90hz refresh rate... It will eat a large chunk of battery

I am in love with this phone and upgrading to this phone is a great choice",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews

The phone quality is top notch. 90hz screen refresh rate gives a buttery smooth experience while using the apps which support it. In-display fingerprint reader is relatively fast and accurate. Haptics is improved and precise but not as good as iPhone which is a lot more expensive.

Battery life is not awesome but decent as it drains out faster when the phone is used heavily while playing games. Although the warp charging does really help out here. The phone charges upto 50% in under 20 mins. This 50% lasts quite a while when used judiciously.

Camera quality is decent again. Photos come out crystal clear and sharp in good lighting. Night photos are not very clear and have a lot of grain. Inbuilt night mode provides a brighter image but still there's grain visible in the photos. Selfie camera is also good. There is the motor noise when the selfie camera pops up and down. I dont recommend using the pop up camera for unlocking the phone.

Considering the price, I would recommend this phone to anyone with this budget. This is 2019's best phone afterall.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews

3. After one week I got this problem again and I called service centre so many times as usual they give me same solution, go to service centre.

4. I already went service centre 3 times and they still tell me to it will work fine.

5. They just give me advise to extend the warranty of phone.

Talking about the Display it's fantastic, you would love to use this device all the time when it is in your hand. I wouldn't say it's big, but rather it's immersive. And rhe refresh rate is just the icing on the cake.

The battery life is also nice, much better than I thought as a day would be enough for a heavy user, and there's no need to worry as the Warp Charger is there to help you out.

Now the main weakness on of this phone is the camera. Well it's not that bad but it's not what everyone would expect from a OnePlus device for the premium pricing, well it's kind of descent, much more similar to the previous generations, just the wide angle lens is the main centre of attraction.

I am just providing some general feedback on what I experienced. I'll write both pros and cons for your reference.
Pros:
1. 90FPS ( you can feel it for sure)
2. Fluid AMOLED display
3. A pretty good camera (you can compare it with Samsung 10 series)
4. Price
5. Latest processor
6. OS and security updates

Cons:
1. Battery - With a 90fps display, the camera isn't that great. However, it will last a day and also gives you an option to choose 60fps to save some battery juice.
2. Hugh camera bump - you should avoid this phone if you prefer to use this phone with no case cover
3. Slippery (not a con, since most of the phones are slippery)

You can go for it as this is the 3rd best android device in the market now next to Asus ROG 2 and OnePlus 7T Pro. You will definitely find this phone worth your month for sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews

Now let's come to OnePlus 7t

Have read many reviews on draining of battery heating up of device which I don't agree on both Mobile gets heat up only while charging.. battery I got for full day with extensive usage. Compared i to OnePlus 6 battery is much better. There is slight vibration on back panel while playing music in full volume.

Macro photography option is superb, have attached one pic of flower with Macro option. Even nightscape option is too good just loved it.

All attached pics are with zero editing.

1. DISPLAY & BUILD QUALITY
-Superb AMOLED screen which is very bright, good in sunlight too
-90HZ refresh rate is an added bonus. 
-If you don't mind that notch, all else is good.
- The form factor is compact and small, making it easy to hold and operate with one hand.
-No Always On display option and No LED notification light.  
-The front and back of phone is thankfully not a fingerprint magnet but attracts lots of dust.
-Overall design of the phone is very good, except for the camera bump. But the front of the phone looks similar to every other cheap notch-wala phones in the market.
-I wish there was water and dust resistance IP rating. 
-No headphone jack and no earphones in the package. Atleast a 3.5mm converter should be included in the package.
-No IR Blaster.

2. OPERATING SYSTEM
-Latest Oxygen OS 10 and Android 10.... best in class.
-OS has lot of customization and is very fluid and easy to use. 
- Does not come with much bloatware and unwanted apps can be uninstalled.

3. CAMERA QUALITY
-Both cameras of this phone are really good for daytime.
-Low light pics and nightscape mode are hopeless.
-Picture processing takes a bit long, especially during night time.
-Major problem is the Portrait Mode, which doesn't work properly. I don't see much background blurred. 
-Wide-angle shots and Macro shots are good.
-I don't like the camera bump, but with the cover on, it is not a hindrance.
-Some more functionalities and settings in the camera are missing.

4.  BATTERY LIFE
-3800 MAH battery is quite adequate for about 7 hours of screen time.
-The 30T warp charger makes up for the battery issue to some extent as charging happens super quick.
-Battery drains faster at 90Hz refresh rate, so i changed it to 60Hz as I am not a gamer.
-I found no heating issues with this phone, but gamers or heavy users can tell about that.

5. SECURITY
-Face unlock and On-screen fingerprint reader are amazingly fast and it unlocks the phone at the blink of an eye.
-The best part is the screen lights up at night, so face unlock works like a charm even in a dark room. 
-Technology here is unmatched, flagship quality but I find the face unlock unreliable as it recognizes my face in the mirror too and unlocks it.

POINTERS FOR AMAZON
1. Provided me one day delivery for FREE.... thanks Amazon.
2. Proper invoice not provided in package or in email.
3. Bank offers and discounts made it a sweet deal.

POINTS FOR ONEPLUS
1. Amazing upgrade to the OnePlus 7 phone, but customers of previous iterations will be disappointed for not waiting for the best model.
2. Free two year warranty on phone if you register with OnePlus Care App.
3. Very nice quality phone back cover provided in the package.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros:
Display- 5+/5
Camera 4.5/5
Touch-4.7/5
Battery-4/5
Fast changing- 5+/5😜
Fingerprint sensor: 5

Now coming to the in-depth review, first thing was the Display: Which I noticed when I opened the package and switched on the phone was the built in wallpaper animation and that's when I immediately noticed the 90 hz fluid AMOLED display's awesomeness 😍😍. Then the next time was while playing pubg, it's graphics was simply awesome😍. Then again the third time I fell in love was during the display setting when we can manually tune the display colours. And I really longed for a curved edge display phone for a long time and all these features put together felt awesome.

Camera: At first, I was very sceptic about it as there were bad reviews swarming around camera😅. Then immediately the phone was demanding me to update it which I eventually did , which was around 2 gb. And then I took a few picture in artificial lighting with fingers crossed but it was fine. Then post that I thought the camera was not up to the mark😵. But to my surprise it was me who was the culprit 😜 and this came to light when I took some pictures during daylight, also I'm new to the triple camera setup so I was the one to be blamed for and not the phone, then as I got a hold of it the, picture quality was getting better and better 😍. So now I can say it has a pretty decent quality 😉 though it's not in comparison with other flagships out there I'm really happy with it's images also the 3x zoom feature will shock you as there is no loss in the image quality. Portrait mode is awesome but you will have to get used to it, selfie camera is also awesome, which also gives you awesome images 😍.

 Gaming: I'm not s hard core gamer at least in Mobile , since this device has pretty hardware built for games I thought of giving it a try, and to my surprise I fell for it at the login screen as the animations were so pleasing to the eyes 😍 and during the game play there was no frame drops and the gameplay was pretty smooth 👍

Battery: since it's a heavy 4k mAh battery I thought it would last for a more than a day on heavy usage, but it's not so coz of increased resolution and refresh rate, it drains the battery a lot especially during heavy usage, but if we are not using it much the battery easily lasts for 1.5 days, plus the Warp charging, just shatters your perspective about charging, coz it charges three device  from 10-100 in shy of 80 mins which is mind blowing.

Finger print scanner is one of the plus for this device coz it's blazingly fast when compared to it's competitors 👍😍

Oxygen Os: I'm a first time user and to me this interface is just as smooth as butter, the feel, the response,90hz refresh rate, vibrant Display all together is simply awesome. No lags so far. Will update this in coming months.

Only con was the ear phone jack , but that can be resolved using a USB c to 3.5 converters , I used ptron adapter which is amazing and you can also charge and connect to earphones at the same time 😅.

I guess that's it for now will update on near future, if you're planning to buy this you can blindly go for it and won't regret 👍",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews

I used one plus 5t, Oneplus 6, One plus 7 and now one plus 7t. Out of all I did not like 7T. To be frank, One Plus 7 was much much better than 7T.
1. Fingure print censor doesnt work all time
2. Battery drains out before noon ( pls note that I dont play games, I dont watch Videos much and I dont play songs).
3. Most of the features are repeated from One Plus 7. But rear camera of One plus 7T is much better ( I am not telling one plus 7 camera was bad. It was really good... But this camera is better than one plus 7)
4. Speed is best. I have 8GB RAM. Really good.

Don't waste your money on this phone @this price range.
Many customers faces same as I am facing the issue of screen flickering while watching videos specially YouTube.. if u do not noticed, now notice it on the upper side where the notch is setup. Play YouTube u can see when u do for full screen and again normal.
I am purchased it but thanks to Amazon they replaced it but again same issue 'screen flickering' and again thanks to Amazon they approve my return and now I get my refund..
But seriously this device is not too good at this price. So pls don't waste your money.

Difference of RAM and a higher memory with pop up selfie would have been 'the extra' for pro users.

There is no earphone with c-type connector (ofcourse of good quality) which makes it less value for money.

And yes this too hangs at times, so I do not totally agree with 'the speed' factor of One Plus.
Honestly, I didn't find even iPhone X woth or Latest galaxy worth the price tags.

Misery Nature of One Plus Brand,Reviewed in India on 9 August 2019,"No doubt one plus is very good mobile. It is very smooth, processor is fast. No hanging problem. I am writing this comments only after using 2days. So it may not be accurate/valuable comment. But what I don't like in this mobile is u can't use earphone coz it has only one port for charging and USB cable support. To use ear phone, u have to purchase an earphone connector which can't be a genuine product as not given by one plus company. At the same price, Apple mobile gives Type-C type earphone and also earphone connector. But after taking 33000, still one plus is not giving those things. So it's a biggest demerits of this handset.

But investing 40k and getting battery backup of 9-10 hours really worse. the finger print is much faster in phone costing 10k.

I'll list below the few pros and cons that I found while using the phone. I used to have second thoughts about buy a notched phone cus I thought the notch would annoy me, but after getting this phone I hardly notice the notch thanks to the amoled and deep blacks, in a dark room the notch is completely invisible.

Pros
1. 90hz amoled display is amazing, once you go 90hz there's no turning back to 60hz
2. The phone weight is distributed equally and hence its comfortable for one had use for a long period of time
3. The stereo speaker setup is better than expected
4. RAM boost technology actually works well, I see the apps I use often open up faster.
5. Not much of a camera user, but the sample pics I've taken have come out well
6. Fingerprint reader is fast, takes longer to unlock after a bath, wrinkly fingers

Cons.
1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided in the box
2. The battery capacity could have been increased although using it in 60hz gives better battery life. But I don't think anyone is gonna do that :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews

1) The space is massive upto 128 GB so really need not worry about the space

2) Frankly this is my second One Plus, my earlier one is One Plus 6T which is blazing fast got this it's much more blazing fast.

3) You may think the features & options of One Plus 7T & Redmi Note 8 Pro are similar but trust the facts One Plus 7T is leagues ahead of Redmi or any iPhone or any phone.

4) The options and way of working is really really fast compared to any other phone.

5) Most importantly it's all about regular updates and timely fixes. The One Plus community is pretty strong here.

1. This is a performance phone absolutely no doubt about it but it isn't delivering the top notch performance, it takes around 2-3 seconds to load just after restart.

2. Caller picture is getting blurred. I tried with some third party apps also but the issue still exists with some caller. But when I set caller picture  for any contact with phone's default caller picture feature, I'm still getting blurred image when I call someone.

3. Sometimes (let's say 2 out of 10 times) when connected with Bluetooth headset the sound output flickers, when phone is locked. Works fine when phone is unlocked. However, it get resolved while I disconnect the device and reconnect.

4. Sometimes I feel heating issues with this phone (I'm not a PUBG guy, I don't play heavy games on phone). With normal usage, I feel heating issues. However, occurrence frequency of this issue is very low.

5. Sometimes I don't see music navigation layout when phone is locked. I have to restart the device, then able to see the navigation buttons on lock screen.

I'll reach out to One Plus service center and hope they'll resolve it.

Overall this is a good choice within 40k bracket,  AMOLED + 90Hz display is awesome. Camera in daylight is great. Haven't tested the supermicro shots. Nightmode picture quality lies between good to very good (very good excluded).

Thanks,
A satisfied One Plus user (If they resolve the above mentioned issues😃 )",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

But I recieved the product in Monday 20th May only..it was such a very bad experience with Amazon Becz even though I was a prime customer I recieved the product very late.. I raised many issues and complaints within that date to get the product on time. I felt very bad about the delivery service of Amazon team..

Note regarding the beast and flagship of 2K19.. we happy to buy one plus product again. I was already using one plus 6 for the last 8 months. Always the one plus is so fast and good in performance and built quality. The same and with more performance and balanced Battery back up in the new one plus 7 pro. The box itself was awesome. The phone build quality is remarkable. The display is the main highlight of the product such an awesome clarity and movie experience on the phone. The fast movement with 90hz is really awesome. Felt like new whenever I use the phone. Camera quality has been improved a lot. Day time the photos are awesome and the new nightscape is also good .. The front camera is better and fast. Overall I can give 8.5/10 for camera Becz there is still some lag in picture quality and the contrast of colours while taking a picture when compared to other flagship mobiles. Next the most fastest indisplay finger print is speechless.. no lag or no delay even in extreme dark.. happy that the one plus products are always awesome and they are continuously improving the products. The battery was little bit okay for me im getting just 5 hours of screen time only. But I Hope that the upcoming updates will improve the battery life. So I can give 8/10 for battery and 10/10 for performance. The animation is also awesome whenever we open the phone through finger print the live wallpaper is remarkable. Overall I'm very much happy to buy this awesome product only I felt little bad about the price and there was no connector for earphones. The price is not too high but I expected little less. Anyways this is the new beast of 2K19. Since I won't be playing that much games so I bought 6gb variant Becz last time I bought 8gb variant it will be even more faster but drains the battery fastly. So I decided to go on with 6gb. I recommend everyone to buy this flagship killer and those who will use the phone for more personal and normal use they can easily go with 6gb variant",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

You won't find any area where OnePlus has not checked the box.
• Excellent performance.
• Camera good enough.
• Loved the dual dolby speakers. You can feel the surround sound without headphones. Awesome for watching movies and videos.
• I have always loved OnePlus design, and this doesn't disappoint a bit. Premium feel in the hands.
• Display is fantastic for 4k content.
• Battery has been good until now. Battery discharge a bit faster when refresh rate is 90hz ( Expected , needs to be compromised somewhere :P )
• Only con I have is missing headphone jack. I had recently purchased Sony extrabass wired earphones for my OnePlus 5 ( I know converter can be used, but couldn't find one for now).

Battery life is not great. For average usage, it lasts only for about 12 to 25 hours
Camera quality is good, though I was expecting front flash.
One fundamental issue I observed is with selfie. Even average phones will negate the mirror image of text but it is not done by this high end phone
GPS quality is not good. I got jumbled maps with my fitness app
Charger is very good

Although it looks very sleek and stylish, performance and features are not so much of a step up from OnePlus 6.

The bigger size is not a  positive. Although video and games look better, the screen is too big for one hand texting and operation.

No significant improvement in battery life. Pretty much same battery life as op6.

No headphone jack is a negative, though Bluetooth works flawlessly!

On screen fingerprint reader is a bit meh. No haptic feedback and doesn't work 100% of the time.

Camera is the biggest let down. Better resolution hasn't translated to better pictures. Selfies were so much better with op6.

Pros at a glance
1. Worlds first phone with UFS 3.0, the phone is stupendously fast.
2. QHD Screen with 90hz refresh rate, a very first on oneplus device. Once you get used to 90hz display all the other phones will be a joke in terms of scrolling performance.
3. Great camera. Camera is great , though not to the level of many other flagships its great and there will gcam mods which will improve the quality.
4. Stereo Speakers, again a very first on oneplus device, excellent quality.
5. SD855 onboard.
6. Warp Charge at 30W is sufficient enough to compensate the battery performance with 90hz display

Cons at a glance
1. No headphone jack.

What a great experience!!!,Reviewed in India on 31 May 2019,"I was an apple fanboy since 2007. I had used every iPhone that got released in the market till iPhone X (not iPhone XS).  Since I got bored with the same OS for so many number of years, one fine day I decided to try android (keeping aside my ethical reservations about it, since it was an stolen OS as per late Steve Jobs)  and bought an Android AMOLED Phone (to test whether I can thrive on android eco system) which had an on screen finger print scanner.  Strangely, I started liking that android phone  since it had an iOS feel and used it for more  than 6 months.

By then I was quite confident that I can rely on an android phone without any regrets and started looking for a flagship phone that can match to iPhone, in terms of Overall User Experience. While Galaxy S10 was one of the obvious choice, I was some how not happy with it(may be due to Apple Vs Samsung Long term dispute) , but  then  the OPP7 got released. :-)

I waited and bought 12GB RAM+256GB Storage Phone on Amazon. Before I bought this phone I had read through many reviews online and got really worried about issues posted about this phone,  like ghost display, Mediocre Camera, bad call quality etc etc. Also many reviews for this phone on the  Amazon ltself was not good.  Still I stuck to my decision of buying this phone and let me tell you that I am extremely proud of my decision.

Once I got this phone then it simply turned out to be an outstanding phone and completely changed my perceptions about stock android experience. Now I would want to say that it is one of the best phones in the market. While there are many good features as well few shortfalls on this phone,  end of the day the overall user experience is something that I liked utmost.

My key take aways about the phone are

- I am awestruck with the edge to edge, QHD AMOLED Display with 90 Hz refresh rates and the curved display. You can view everything at  best on this phone.
- 12 Gigs RAM keeps the phone blazing fast on all the games I downloaded, of course Snapdragon 855 is an extremely efficient CPU.
- Camera: While this was one of the concerns reported utmost by all in the reviews, with the latest software update I would want to say that I could make great photographs with both  48 pixel normal camera as well as with the pop-up Front facing camera. I simply loved the pictures I took on this phone and I am quite confident that it matches to the quality of iPXs Max even at the low light conditions (ensure for latest software updates). The 4k Video captures are great delight.
- Warp charge: Can't belive that it took less than hour to charge my phone from less than 5 to 100 %. I have to say Kudos.
- Oxygen OS: Simply minimalistic, yet very beautiful. One Plus team has paid every attention to the detail in building this OS. All my need for using a Gesture based OS is completely taken care.
- Speakers: Great Stereo speaker alignment with Dolby Atmos experience. While it sounds great, I would want to say that it is not the best audio experience. However there are no regrets.
- Build Quality: Overall build quality is absolute wonderful. I loved that buttery touch whether on the screen or on the back.
- Weight: That 206 gm of weight in the hand made me to feel that it is a worthy and reliable phone and not just another one of the bunch in the market.
- Pre-applied screen guard: Very Happy about it. At least it is not tamper prone out of box. Same logic for the free case that ensures that my device is safe, atleast initially.
- Size: While I have seen many complaints about the giagantic size of this phone, my take on it is that it is simply fine. After all for the greater user experience we do need a good screen size phone.
- Notifications: Let me tell you that I am extremely particular about the efficiency of notifications from SMS and Whatsapp messages. While my earlier android phone is not efficient as iPhone in this aspect, OP7P had ensured this to me. Very greatful!!

Area of Improvements
- Battery life: Unless we are concious about managing battery life, it may not lost long especially with the 90 Hz screen refresh rates
- No Wireless Charging: Personally I damn care about it. I never used that feature in my iPhone X. But still a drawback.
- No Headphone: Exactly same as above. Something not worry much with many bluetooth headphone options. I have paired my Airpod and it works simply great.
- No IP Rating: I am very much sure that this phone is splash resistant as well  water resistant for minimal time and I am extremely happy with it. After all I am not a professional swimmer with the intent to use this phone underwater. (with all due respect to the swimmmers)

Few aspects about my purchase from Amazon:
- Concept of guaranteed price for phones from Amazon was very useful for me. I exchanged my recently bought first android phone and got a good value for exchange
- Interest free EMI and discount on my SBI card made me to feel happy
- Almost same day delivery of the phone. What else I can ask for.

Finally I would want to say that I am not paid by any one (especially by OPO) to write this review but it is an honest user experience by a tech enthusiast.  Still, for any questions, please feel free to write a reply to this post and I will try to respond it asap.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews

1.Fast and buttery smoot- its so fast and smooth that you can hardly tell its opening the simple application or resuming it from ram.
2.Display - 90hz display with FHD+ resolution will spoil you, it will literally make u swipe up n down without any reason.
3.Speaker - Good stereo speakers will enhance your media consumption experience.
4.Battery - Getting good battery life , on an avg 7 hrs SOT with gaming abt 3hrs.
5.Weight n size - Size doesn't bother me n yeah its lil heavy however i guess i ll get use to it.- one downside it that if u drop it prone to break due to its heavness.
6.IP rating - Not n issue, its tested by manu YouTuber ,i.e it can survive lil water and anyway no company gives you warranty against water damage.
7.WI-fi - Geting the speed ISP provide. So no issue.
8. Wireless charging - Fast charging is enough.
9.Camera - Decent not as good as pixel. Can improve with gcam .This is the area one plus needs to improve.
10.No headphone jack- really missing that , i hv Bluetooth earphone but in gameplay u need wired headset or else it gt lilbit delay via Bluetooth so bought a dongle n getting use to it.
11.Anything extra will incurred the cost also so at this price point all acceptable.

It has every thing you want
Pros
1.snapdragon 855+ extremely smooth and eccentric performance
2.android 10 out of box is quite fantastic
3.ram management is effective and most of the time u have 70% of the ram available as free even after gaming .
4.the display is epic and I personally prefer flat screen so it is nice smooth and fabulous the 90hz display is extremely satisfying and even it has an option to reduce to 60hz which is quite handy.
5. Camera is absolutely amazing ,crisp quality top notch performance low light to outdoor perfect scenarios the camera performes as expected and crazy as hell.even the 4k video with 60fps is stunning . Front can is quite good with nice color contrast and white balance gets u wonderful indor and outdoor selfies .
6.gaming beast .pubg, cod , fortnite runs extremely smooth with 90hz display the games are amazing.
7.battery is good as it lasted me a day with 20% remaining that to playing games for 10 to 20 min with gps and mobile data on for the most of the time .avg on screen time 6hr 20 min to 7hr (if not playing games and gps turned off ...u get better time).
8.WARP charge is beast .In 20min the phone charged from 8% to 84% which is silly fast and crazy as hell . Charge for 20min and enjoy full day battery .
9. one more thing it even now support hdr streaming in Netflix and prime which is quite good and satisfying ( I didn't check with previous ones if they have ignore this point).
10.oxygen OS is upgraded and customization is very nice and for dark and theme lovers it will be extremely satisfying and convinient to use .
11.build quality is amazing the panel is smooth and matte like feel is nice .it comes with preapplied protector on screen and it's good .we get PVC back case which is nice and firmly holds the phone

Cons:
1.the mighty headphone jack is gone and it's quite a bummer . One plus doesn't provide the extended type c to 3 .5 mm jack which is disappointing, but in the world of Bluetooth this can be adjusted.
2.NO LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT this is personal choice and I prefer to have notification light which indicates any notifications and charge indication..
3.no memory slot which is kind of ok with me but still who doesn't want extra storage 😉

Verdict: premium phone with flagship features and BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK . If u are premium lover just go for it .go.goo..gooooo.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

fingerprint - for security I only use fingerprint and didn't see any delay working great.
Camera - they use triple camera which is similar to pro and they are best at their price.
Software - as you know oneplus is known for its own software oxygen os which is closed to stock and highly customised.
You can wake your screen by holding the phone, you can switch your call Bluetooth to earpiece by just putting your phone to your ears, double to wake and sleep and many more.

Thank you oneplus for making wonderful phone.

Jsut buy 7t and save money plus no fragile curve screen. Buy 128 varient which was at the time of sale people got in 36k which a good price for such a package. Display, camera, smoothness every thing is great.

I am going to write about cons because there are a lot of merit and few demerit

Cons :- battery backup, telephoto lens colour production, a bit heavy and tall, camera need few ota updates to produce natural image but it will get improve over time

Things can be improved - make it a bit small like 6.3, should have 3.5mm if not at least bundle a dongle, telephoto should have ois just like pro varient, can be a bit cheap if the phone was small in size",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews

Cons
-- Phone heats up while playing the game and this not what I expected for a 12 GB RAM, RAM size is literally a waste of money.
-- Phone is bulky fat and heavy does not fit in all kind of pant pockets.
--  Battery life is worse than my previous OnePlus 5T I regret giving away my 5T for this.

Pros

Night mode pictures
Notch less full-size display.

My OnePlus 5T was a lot better than this I will not buy a OnePlus again better by a Samsung. or Huawei.  I believe this no much difference with OnePlus 7T either.

It turns out the hype is real and once you start using this display, it's hard to use the one on the 6t or any other phone (60 hz I believe). You can actually tell the difference.

The all-screen no-notch display is excellent and with 516 ppi, the display is very sharp and the performance is super fast. (I got the 12/256 version).

Although you can turn the display back to output 60hz, you'll get so used to the 90hz that you'll have a hard time adjusting.

Got it on the Diwali offer on Amazon with quick and damage-free delivery.

Don't really use the selfie camera much on any phone, so can't really comment on that. But it does help that it's hidden on top so that you get a notch-free display. Can't comment on the back camera either as I'm not really a big photo-taking person.

Should you get the 7t Pro instead of this? It depends, if you just want the McLaren edition or the 855+ chipset. Otherwise, this is an amazing option as it released just four months before and at the current price for the maxed out 12/256 version, it makes a lot of sense that you go for this.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews

Flagship level in almost every way.,Reviewed in India on 2 January 2020,"100% satisfaction with this phone thus far! Love the design, the performance, Oxygen OS, it's a whole lot better than what my previous phone in Samsung was. Doesn't heat up at all, never lags or hangs.

With that being said it's early days I'm hoping it stands the test of time and it's only been about a month of usage, but thus far I'm loving every second of it.

Battery usage lasts for between 8 and half to 10 hours of screen on time usage and generally lasts for the 24 hours for a heavy user like me. Generally charges from nearly empty to a 100 in a little less than an hour. Charges to 90 in about 50 minutes and to 70 in little over half an hour.

Not a huge camera user but from what I have used of it I'm satisfied with it. Phones like Pixel would obviously be better in that department but it wouldn't let you down. This is probably the only area where it's not flagship level. Otherwise it feels premium in almost every other way.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews

The wait was worth it. The phone is bundled in a premium box with a letter from the founder and invitation to join the OnePlus forums. This was a nice touch.
Retail box: Box contains the device, warp charger, documentation, SIM eject tool and a clear silicone phone sleeve. Headphones and/or USB type c to 3.5 mm jack is missing. 4/5
Design: I ordered the nebula blue version of the phone. The front of the phone is all display with minimal bezels. The curved front gives a premium appearance to the device. The back of the device has a frosted blue glass finish. The back is resistant to fingerprints while the front is a fingerprint magnet. The phone has stereo speakers with the earpiece above the display functioning as one of the loudspeakers. The bottom firing speaker is present on the bottom bezel of the screen. The loudspeakers are loud and produce pleasant sound.
Display: the QHD 90Hz HDR AMOLED display is a gorgeous work of art. The display is buttery smooth and the experience of interaction with the curved screen is a joy. The embedded in display fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate.
Camera: the front popup camera is a fixed focus unit. It produces bright images with adequate amount of details. The front camera is good for video calls. The back 48 MP camera is good in bright light conditions. Produces noisy images in low light conditions. Using GCAM or nightscape mode helps render usable night shots. The wide angle camera is a nice addition but the rendition and the amount of resolved detail are inadequate. The telephoto camera helps create 3x lossless zoom. The resolved details are usable for social media but not good for prints.
Performance: the phone is blazing fast. The 8 GB RAM is more than adequate for day to day usage. The on board storage is blazing fast. The OxygenOS is a great implementation of android that is fast and has many usable additions to stock android.
Battery life: The battery lasts 2 days with my daily usage involving 1 hour of web browsing, 1 hour of streaming videos and about 1 hour of phonecalls. The bundled fast charger is great. It charges the battery to 80% in 30 minutes.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_63?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=63&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pros
*Amazing Display ( with modes to adjust to save battery life )
*UFS 3.0 tested and it's actually fast.
*Good battery life
*Good Sound Quality compared to all other one plus device
*Sufficient storage and we'll optimized ram management
* Best Nightscape mode ( Camera only this feature )

Come
* Feels heavy while operating
* Camera is okay and needs a lot of upgrade where OnePlus will eventually fix it post testing
* No accessories like headphone or ctype to 3.5 convertor
* Wireless charging
* IP water resistant rating ( but it's splash proff and needs to be dried of soon )

Processor is Superb 👍
Camera is okay but fair enough .. love the nightscape mode 🌙
Build is Nice 😎
Display is flawless not comments for the same🤘
Sound / Speaker output is just good enough... 👌
Yes the mobile is dam heavy and not for one hand use ...u need dinosaur palm to handle it 😂

1. Screen refresh rate

2. Light weight OS

3. OS Upgrade rate

4. Storage performance (only UFS 3.0 device I am aware in addition to OnePlus 7 as of now - almost twice internal read speed as compared to other devices with UFS 3.0)

5. Benchmark scores on a 2k resolution screen

6. Top quality screen protector already applied with excellent scratch resistance properties

7. Water proofing every holes despite not getting any IP rating

8. WARP charging allow inter operability - DASH charges other OnePlus phones not supporting WARP charging while DASH charging this one when connected to DASH chargers.

9. Better Haptic feedback motor (recall contrast with rotating noisy and least powerful motors till OnePlus 3T)

Competitor with better performance on specific aspects:
1. S10 plus for better overall camera performance especially on wide angle camera

2. S10 plus for brighter and better callibrated screen

3. S10/S10 plus for better in-display fingerprint scanner (Optical vs Ultra sonic). Ultra sonic ones are more accurate while also working on wet or greasy fingers while OnePlus's Optical one is not as secured (even though faster) and doesn't work on smudgy fingers

Needs improvements to loose 1 star rating:
1. In-display fingerprint scanner is not as fast or accurate as earlier capacitive vector sensors with ceramic coating on OnePlus

2. Wide angle camera has terrible lens/sensor

3. Falsely claiming 3x Optical zoom and forcefully cropping a 13 megapixels image to 8 megapixels to achieve a 3x zoom from a 2.2x Optical zoom lens. Not allowing 13 megapixels images to be captured using the entire 13 megapixel camera even if manually zooming at 2.2x (which uses primary sensor only with Digital zoom)

4. Still not going for wireless charging capabilities or IP ratings despite significantly increasing prices to compete with flagship phones and fragile glass back design

5. Irratic touch response and ghost touch issues. Almost impossible to press and hold touch to get accurately recognizes around the corners (bottom right particularly when using SwiftKey)

6. Poor quality selfie camera despite having 16 megapixels since OnePlus 3, hardly any improvements with same 1080p video recording

7. No USB 3.1 cable included. Dash and Warp chargers only work by using additional USB 3.1 lines for parallel charging circuits and hence doesn't support USB 3.1 data lines despite the phone FINALLY having USB 3.1 data port

8. Bulky phone and still not having Headphones Socket. Using USB C to Headphones Adapter works fine but looses crispness of highs when compared to direct Headphones socket on OnePlus 5,etc.

9. Uses SWAP file (ZRAM) all the time even on a 8GB RAM phone with no option to disable - significantly reducing performance and battery life while swapping RAM content to Storage and visa versa

10. Oneplus 7 6GB/128GB and LG v40 renewed versions seems more practical choice with similar speeds and features respectively while keeping the weight in check

11. Supplied back cover is decent but the USB C charging port cover is flimsy and gets sticking out after using the port for more than 30 mins

12. While the OS keep getting frequent updates, it lacks novelty like Samsung phones with changes in looks, Always on display, etc. Looks and feels the same like a OnePlus 3 phone as they are still snappy with similar OS and features (except for the hardware specific new ones incremental in each newer models)

13. Can't use wide angel or zoom lenses in Pro mode or Video capture making them useless except for regular point and shoot usage. Complete waste of hardware making OnePlus 7 almost as good for practical and advanced usage. Also, like above, camera software still has the same UI as OnePlus 3 with no option to change photo resolution (other than aspect ratio) or shoot HDR videos which even LG V30 has been supporting for long while all smartphones from major manufacturers have always had option to choose photo resolution",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-604/product-reviews/B07HGLBZ5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews

Battery life is fantatic can get you a day and more also and the charger is the best, charges in no time

I loved Pixel's camera and was planning to buy Pixel 4 but alas it didn't launch in India. So I wanted to check for other phones and decided to reduce the budget of the phone. I wanted a decent camera, UI close to stock android and a good camera. I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.

PROS
- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)
- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast
- The display is very good
- Build is nice

CONS
- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)
- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.

Nowadays almost all (even budget) smartphones provide decent battery life, good camera etc.
Being a flagship smartphone that too worth Rs 53000, it was expected to be much better than just mid range smartphones.

The major issue which I had faced is with the network connectivity. It used to get disconnected from network every now and then(approx after every 5-7 mins) and I had to manually reconnect it by going to settings option. Even when the hotspot was turned on, all the devices which were connected to it used to get disconnected after every 5-10 mins.
Finally I had to sell my oneplus 7 pro at half price and bear a loss of around 25000.

The display quality is average (not at all the best in market). The screen is curved like samsung s9 plus but the display quality is nowhere near samsung flagships.

The only thing which I liked about the 7 pro was the charging speed and decent battery life. But one should not be spending 53000 for just good battery life.

Only Suggestion to #Oneplus would be: instead of bringing out 4-5 same phones per year, work properly on one device so that customers won't be disappointed. Like there is a limit....oneplus 7, oneplus 7 pro, oneplus 7t, oneplus 7t pro...are you crazy ????",1.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews

The battery life of the phone is quite good and gives me 2 whole days on my use (4G is always on, bluetooth rarely, extensive calls, not much video). Also, even with the battery saver on, the performance of the display is very smooth (60Hz refresh rate and not 90Hz though that is available too). Since there is no 3.5mm headphone jack, music quality with USB earphones or even bluetooth ones suffers a bit (not an issue with the phone but just that accessories don't make the cut). Fingerprint reader is a big dud and one has to press many times at times for it to unlock. Not much of a camera buff and hence can't really comment on that.

Talking about the ROG 2 - Its a great gaming phone, having a long lasting battery with good charging.
But if you are purchasing a phone for its :
*LOOKS
*CAMERA
*SCREEN
*FAST BLAZING CHARGING
*VALUE FOR MONEY
*UI
*ANDROID 10.

I am sure you are missing nothing at all here.
It is actually a great purchase on its own at 36K .. ..

The iPhone 11 stands no where nearer to it if we compare the overall features of both.
The iPhone camera is amazing.
But is it worth Paying - 25000/- more for just a camera having LCD Screen & a small 60HZ display.
You can end up buying another phone or two at 25K for sure.

I got the phone on 29th thanks to Amazon prime account. First impressions on look is amazing the new forsted sliver is first of its kind in smartphones.
Pros:
Android 10 out of the box, all software updates was done. 90hz fluid display is amazing you can free the difference with smaller notch. Rear camera performance is good as you accept from OnePlus phones. Nightmode is very impressive I mean you can get pictures in very dark environment with very low light pretty decent. Performance no issues as it comes with 8GB RAM and best chip set in the market. 30WT waap charge is amazingly fast this will resolve the 3800 mAh battery issue, literally it's crazy fast. Almost forgot the new micro camera feature is fantastic you can shot object from as low as 2.5 cm distance ( stability can be an issue ).
Lastest oxygen os simple and fast as always. This makes the phone one of the best in this prize range. Almost missed the back cover is also of good quality 👍 for that.

Cons:
3.5mm jack missing- biggest for me as I have a great headphone for same.
No usb-c to 3.5 jack donggle is provided.
Selfie camera could have been better ( can improve with software updates )
Camera bump for some ( okay for me )",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-747/product-reviews/B07DJCVTDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

Camera and processor everything is nice.
But I have been facing two issue - BATTERY DRAINAGE and HEATING.
1. I have to charge it twice in 24hour. This is when I keep my brightness to almost minimum, usage is only for 4g and listening music via non-
Bluetooth earphones.
In case I connect to Bluetooth Earphones then battery drainage is even quicker (so I avoid it)

2. During video calling, I noticed that phone starts heating heavily.

-Excellent performance, fast bootup and instant app loadup
-Display is the one that impresses me the most with its 90hz refresh rate and curved glass
-Build quality is great, slim design and glass back give the premium feel
-OxygenOs is great, gives one of the best UI experience
-Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos makes the sound crisp, clear and loud.
-Has gaming mode which boosts up the performance while gaming
-Camera is great, but needs improvement.
-Charging is very fast and also doesn't refrain from using phone while charging
-Lastly, on screen fingerprint scanner is very fast and accurate

What I dislike/ poorly like-

-No headphone jack
-Box hardly contains any accessories unlike other flagship phones; no type-c adapter, no complimentary headphones, no otg cable; only charger and sim ejector tool
-Hybrid Sim slot
-Photos clicked have heavy detail loss, when magnified the objects far away seems smudged, not expected in a flagship phone like this.
-Face unlock is a bit slow due to popup mechanism
-Battery drain is high when operating it at QHD+ resolution and 90hz display but can go for a day with moderate use.
-Factory applied screen protector is of very low quality, doesn't even stick properly on the edges
-Finally, price is bit high compared to other flagship phones with similar specification.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews

i think every one knows about its specs and looks so i dont need to tell about that all
I just tell you about its brief battery life
So if you are going to use this phone for calls whatsapp and media consumption you will get 5 or 5 n half hrs of screen on time or you can increase a bit by lower the screen refresh rate and resolution

But If you play PUBG in this mobile then it will give you max 4:30 mins SOT and if you use its fanatic mode then you will get 4 hrs of SOT if you lower its resolution and screen referesh rate then it increase a bit by 15 min or half an hours of time

You will get Warp charger in the box which is 30w charger so you can full charge your device 1:30 hrs

Ove all its a gud purchase and after purchase i got 3 to 4 OTA updates and oneplus rectify its bugs and camera issues and lots of minor improvements
Alao if you are planning to buy this phone then buy one armoured case for the phone security aa phone is very slim and you can not handle without case
if budget is not your concern you can definitely go for it or else you can look for op 7

Cons

Received the device on May 31st, delivery was done efficiently, Thank you Amazon.
The Nebula blue device looks beautiful. Good work Oneplus.

From two days of experience (will edit comment if anything new comes up):
Pros:
Everything in the news hold true -
1. Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.
2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.
3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)
4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.

Cons:
Again, the news holds true.
1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.
2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.
3. Phone hangs/stutters when re-used after a long break. Not sure if this is android's fault or oneplus'

Current verdict: This is one of the best phones out there, pricey but effective. Go for it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-606/product-reviews/B07HGJK535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

Well the phone is just the best in class as on date..
Really worth for money..
Everything in it are damn new.  Snapdragon 855""+"" chip set.. All new 90hz display. Wide screen. Etc etc

Camera quality well the images do come original when compared to other ones especially the all new developed macro mode. Super cool. But I still find a room for improvisation here & there.

Hmm to say about battery.. that's where I can say one plus should have improved a bit. It's like we all have good fruits in hand but unfortunately the fridge isn't working properly 😁😁 something like that..
3.8k mAh battery do support you as a nominal use but I say if we are into  games or internet (heavy usage) it starts draining.
For a normal usage it dies to 1.5. Days but as I said before the company could have improved..

Wrap charging does the work rapidly so doesn't stall you from anything..

In short.. just dont overthink just go for it.

PROS

1. DISPLAY + DESIGN
The 6.41 inch waterdrop display is vivid with 660 nits brightness. Outdoor visibility is great.
The design of the phone is very CLASSY just like iphones. I hate splashy gradient backs of OPPO, VIVO and KILLER2.0.

2.DUAL SPEAKERS
Don't believe the youtubers who say THEY DO NOT HAVE TRUE STEREO EFFECT LIKE APPLE. They are amazing and super loud.

3.OXYGEN OS
I feel that this UI is the greatest even when compared with IOS and STOCK. The device is supremely fast with zero lags. The polished features like Zenmode, screen recorder, fnatic mode and many more are pure magic.

4. HAPTIC ENGINE.
I have used this vibration motor and it performs absolutely great on par with apple and Google haptic engines. When I went in a Croma store I have observed the haptic engine of Samsung S10 and and I was surprised to know that my oneplus 7 had better haptics then the S10.

5. FINGERPRINT SCANNER
The fingerprint scanner is blazing fast with 96% accuracy however it doesn't detect your fingerprint when I hands a dirty or oily. but still it is the fastest fingerprint scanner that I have ever used in a smartphone.

6.CAMERA.
The front facing 16 megapixel camera with Sony Imx 471 sensor take stunning photos with high contrast that is Instagram ready pictures. The rear facing 48 megapixel Sony IMX 586 sensor camera has beautiful photos with accurate colours and the video quality is impeccable. Don't listen to the paid youtubers who mostly promote ASUS 6Z.

7. CALL QUALITY AND NETWORK RECEPTION works
Exceptional well with no issues.

CONS

1. No HEADPHONE JACK
2. No DONGLE
3. No WIDE ANGLE CAMERA

Conclusion
I am not a fan of pop up cameras, flagship killers 2.0 or for the Zen phones UI experience. I am not a fool to be in favour of oneplus but the experience of having one will definitely change your perspective and you will stick to one plus forever even if you will use it once in your life so I will recommend you to choose the mirror blue variant that is the base variant because in today's world 128 GB ROM and 6 GB of Ram are more than enough especially for oxygen OS and the colour is magnificent. As a matter of fact, the top varient of flagship killer 2.0 is just 2000 rupees cheaper when compared to the base variant of oneplus. If I would have been in your place I would have definitely gone for oneplus.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page→,https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-611/product-reviews/B07HGMLBW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews
